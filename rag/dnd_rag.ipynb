Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.The Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game is about \\nstorytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. It shares ele -\\nments with childhood games of make-believe. Like those \\ngames, D&D is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing \\nthe towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and \\nimagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the \\nchallenges that scene presents.\\n Dungeon Master (DM): After passing through the \\ncraggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east \\nand Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crumbling \\ntowers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach. \\nThey look like abandoned guardhouses. Beyond these, a \\nwide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep fog below. \\nA lowered drawbridge spans the chasm, leading to an \\narched entrance to the castle courtyard. The chains of \\nthe drawbridge creak in the wind, their rust-eaten iron \\nstraining with the weight. From atop the high strong walls, \\nstone gargoyles stare at you from hollow sockets and grin \\nhideously. A rotting wooden portcullis, green with growth, \\nhangs in the entry tunnel. Beyond this, the main doors of \\nCastle Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling into \\nthe courtyard.  \\n Phillip (playing Gareth): I want to look at the gargoyles. I \\nhave a feeling they’re not just statues.\\n Amy (playing Riva):  The drawbridge looks precarious? I \\nwant to see how sturdy it is. Do I think we can cross it, or \\nis it going to collapse under our weight? \\n Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure to \\nthe stories, a way of determining the consequences of the \\nadventurers’ action. Players roll dice to resolve whether \\ntheir attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers \\ncan scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical \\nlightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous task. Any -\\nthing is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more \\nprobable than others.\\n Dungeon Master (DM): OK, one at a time. Phillip, you’re \\nlooking at the gargoyles?\\n Phillip: Yeah. Is there any hint they might be creatures \\nand not decorations?\\n DM: Make an Intelligence check.\\n Phillip: Does my Investigation skill apply?\\n DM: Sure!\\n Phillip (rolling a d20): Ugh. Seven.\\n DM: They look like decorations to you. And Amy, Riva is \\nchecking out the drawbridge?\\n In the Dungeons & Dragons game, each player cre -\\nates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams \\nup with other adventurers (played by friends). Working together, the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ru -\\nined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep in a jungle, \\nor a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious mountain. \\nThe adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other char -\\nacters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover fabulous \\nmagic items and other treasure.\\n One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon \\nMaster (DM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The \\nDM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate \\nits hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM \\nmight describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft, and the \\nplayers decide what they want their adventurers to do. \\nWill they walk across the dangerously weathered draw -\\nbridge? Tie themselves together with rope to minimize \\nthe chance that someone will fall if the drawbridge gives \\nway? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm?\\n Then the DM determines the results of the adventurers’ \\nactions and narrates what they experience. Because the \\nDM can improvise to react to anything the players at -\\ntempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can \\nbe exciting and unexpected.\\n The game has no real end; when one story or quest \\nwraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing \\nstory called a campaign . Many people who play the \\ngame keep their campaigns going for months or years, \\nmeeting with their friends every week or so to pick up \\nthe story where they left off. The adventurers grow in \\nmight as the campaign continues. Each monster de -\\nfeated, each adventure completed, and each treasure \\nrecovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also \\nearns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase \\nin power is reflected by an adventurer’s level.\\n There’s no winning and losing in the Dungeons & \\nDragons  game—at least, not the way those terms are \\nusually understood. Together, the DM and the players \\ncreate an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront \\ndeadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to \\na grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in \\nby a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can \\nsearch for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, \\nor the player might choose to create a new character to \\ncarry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure \\nsuccessfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a \\nmemorable story, they all win.\\nWorlds of Adventure\\nThe many worlds of the Dungeons & Dragons game \\nare places of magic and monsters, of brave warriors and \\nspectacular adventures. They begin with a foundation of \\nmedieval fantasy and then add the creatures, places, and \\nmagic that make these worlds unique.\\n The worlds of the Dungeons & Dragons game exist \\nwithin a vast cosmos called the multiverse , connected \\nin strange and mysterious ways to one another and to \\nother planes of existence, such as the Elemental Plane \\nof Fire and the Infinite Depths of the Abyss. Within this \\nmultiverse are an endless variety of worlds. Many of \\nthem have been published as official settings for the D&D \\ngame. The legends of the Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Introduction'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='44 Introduction\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.How to Play\\nThe play of the Dungeons & Dragons game unfolds ac -\\ncording to this basic pattern.\\n 1. The DM describes the environment. The DM \\ntells the players where their adventurers are and what’s \\naround them, presenting the basic scope of options that \\npresent themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, \\nwhat’s on a table, who’s in the tavern, and so on).\\n 2. The players describe what they want to do. Some -\\ntimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, \\n“We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times, \\ndifferent adventurers do different things: one adventurer \\nmight search a treasure chest while a second examines \\nan esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps \\nwatch for monsters. The players don’t need to take turns, \\nbut the DM listens to every player and decides how to re -\\nsolve those actions.\\n Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer \\nwants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM \\nmight just say that the door opens and describe what lies \\nbeyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might \\nhide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might \\nmake it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. \\nIn those cases, the DM decides what happens, often \\nrelying on the roll of a die to determine the results of \\nan action.\\n 3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers’ \\nactions. Describing the results often leads to another de -\\ncision point, which brings the flow of the game right back \\nto step 1.\\n This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cau -\\ntiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or \\nlocked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon. In \\ncertain situations, particularly combat, the action is more \\nstructured and the players (and DM) do take turns choos -\\ning and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is \\nfluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the \\nadventure.\\n Often the action of an adventure takes place in the \\nimagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM’s \\nverbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to \\nuse music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the \\nmood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different \\nvoices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other \\ncharacters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM \\nmight lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures \\nto represent each creature involved in a scene to help the \\nplayers keep track of where everyone is.\\nGame Dice\\nThe game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of \\nsides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in \\nmany bookstores.\\n In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the \\nletter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, \\nd12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the \\ntypical cube that many games use).\\n Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You \\ngenerate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two \\ndifferent ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die \\n(designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and \\nthe other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron settings are \\nwoven together in the fabric of the multiverse. Alongside \\nthese worlds are hundreds of thousands more, created \\nby generations of D&D players for their own games. And \\namid all the richness of the multiverse, you might create a \\nworld of your own.\\n All these worlds share characteristics, but each world \\nis set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive \\nmonsters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dun -\\ngeons, and scheming villains. Some races have unusual \\ntraits in different worlds. The halflings of the Dark Sun \\nsetting, for example, are jungle-dwelling cannibals, and \\nthe elves are desert nomads. Some worlds feature races \\nunknown in other settings, such as Eberron’s warforged, \\nsoldiers created and imbued with life to fight in the Last \\nWar. Some worlds are dominated by one great story, like \\nthe War of the Lance that plays a central role in the Drag -\\nonlance setting. But they’re all D&D worlds, and you can \\nuse the rules in this book to create a character and play \\nin any one of them.\\n Your DM might set the campaign on one of these \\nworlds or on one that he or she created. Because there is \\nso much diversity among the worlds of D&D, you should \\ncheck with your DM about any house rules that will affect \\nyour play of the game. Ultimately, the Dungeon Master is \\nthe authority on the campaign and its setting, even if the \\nsetting is a published world.\\nUsing These Rules\\nThe D&D Basic Rules document has four main parts.\\n Part 1  is about creating a character, providing the rules \\nand guidance you need to make the character you’ll play \\nin the game. It includes information on the various races, \\nclasses, backgrounds, equipment, and other customiza -\\ntion options that you can choose from. Many of the rules \\nin part 1 rely on material in parts 2 and 3.\\n Part 2  details the rules of how to play the game, beyond \\nthe basics described in this introduction. That part cov -\\ners the kinds of die rolls you make to determine success \\nor failure at the tasks your character attempts, and de -\\nscribes the three broad categories of activity in the game: \\nexploration, interaction, and combat.\\n Part 3  is all about magic. It covers the nature of magic \\nin the worlds of D&D, the rules for spellcasting, and a \\nselection of typical spells available to magic-using charac -\\nters (and monsters) in the game.\\n Part 4  is especially for the Dungeon Master. It contains \\ninstructions for how to challenge the player characters \\nwith adversaries that are a good test of their abilities, \\nplus dozens of ready-to-use monster descriptions. \\nIt also provides a sampling of magic items that the \\ncharacters can earn as their rewards for vanquishing \\nthose monsters.\\n The end of the document contains supplemental mate -\\nrial. Appendix A collects all the definitions of conditions \\nthat can affect characters and monsters. Appendix B is a \\nbrief discussion of deities in the game, particularly those \\nin the Forgotten Realms setting. Appendix C describes \\nthe five factions in the Forgotten Realms that characters \\ncan become associated with. Finally, a three-page char -\\nacter sheet provides a standardized way for players to \\nrecord and keep track of their characters’ abilities and \\npossessions.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='55 Introduction\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Advantage and Disadvantage\\nSometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw \\nis modified by special situations called advantage and dis -\\nadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances \\nsurrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the \\nopposite. When you have either advantage or disadvan -\\ntage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use \\nthe higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use \\nthe lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if \\nyou have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the \\n5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, \\nyou use the 17.\\n More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are \\npresented in chapter 7.\\nSpecific Beats General\\nThis book contains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3, that \\ngovern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, \\nclass features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and \\nother game elements break the general rules in some \\nway, creating an exception to how the rest of the game \\nworks. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a \\ngeneral rule, the specific rule wins.\\n Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, \\nmany adventurers don’t have proficiency with longbows, \\nbut every wood elf does because of a racial trait. That \\ntrait creates a minor exception in the game. Other exam -\\nples of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For instance, \\nan adventurer can’t normally pass through walls, but \\nsome spells make that possible. Magic accounts for most \\nof the major exceptions to the rules.\\nRound Down\\nThere’s one more general rule you need to know at the \\noutset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round \\ndown if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is \\none-half or greater.\\nAdventures\\nThe Dungeons & Dragons game consists of a group of \\ncharacters embarking on an adventure that the Dungeon \\nMaster presents to them. Each character brings partic -\\nular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability \\nscores and skills, class features, racial traits, equipment, \\nand magic items. Every character is different, with var -\\nious strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of \\nadventurers is one in which the characters complement \\neach other and cover the weaknesses of their compan -\\nions. The adventurers must cooperate to successfully \\ncomplete the adventure.\\n The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with \\na beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might \\nbe created by the Dungeon Master or purchased off the \\nshelf, tweaked and modified to suit the DM’s needs and \\ndesires. In either case, an adventure features a fantastic \\nsetting, whether it’s an underground dungeon, a crum -\\nbling castle, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It \\nfeatures a rich cast of characters: the adventurers created \\nand played by the other players at the table, as well as \\nnonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might \\nbe patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. \\nSome ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, \\nand so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit \\nfrom the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, \\nand 00 and 0 is 100.\\n When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many \\ndice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to \\nadd. For example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eight-\\nsided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.\\n The same d notation appears in the expressions “1d3” \\nand “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide \\nthe number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of \\n1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending \\non whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the num -\\nber rolled is more than half the number of sides on the \\ndie, it’s a 2.)\\nThe D20\\nDoes an adventurer’s sword swing hurt a dragon or just \\nbounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an \\noutrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging \\nriver? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball, \\nor does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In \\ncases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the \\nDungeons & Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided \\ndie, a d20, to determine success or failure.\\n Every character and monster in the game has capa -\\nbilities defined by six ability scores . The abilities are \\nStrength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, \\nand Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for \\nmost adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as \\n1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability \\nmodifiers  derived from them, are the basis for almost \\nevery d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or \\nmonster’s behalf.\\n Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the \\nthree main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the \\nrules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.\\n 1. Roll the die and add a modifier. Roll a d20 and add \\nthe relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier de -\\nrived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes \\nincludes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s par -\\nticular skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each ability and \\nhow to determine an ability’s modifier.)\\n 2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties. A \\nclass feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some \\nother effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.\\n 3. Compare the total to a target number. If the total \\nequals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, \\nattack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it’s a \\nfailure. The DM is usually the one who determines target \\nnumbers and tells players whether their ability checks, \\nattack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.\\n The target number for an ability check or a saving \\nthrow is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target num -\\nber for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC). \\n This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks \\nin D&D play. Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for \\nusing the d20 in the game.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='66 Introduction\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Combat \\nis the most structured element of a D&D session, with \\ncreatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets \\na chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle, \\nthere’s still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to at -\\ntempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs on \\na shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by pulling \\na mysterious lever), and to interact with other creatures, \\nincluding allies, enemies, and neutral parties.\\nThe Wonders of Magic\\nFew D&D adventures end without something magical \\nhappening. Whether helpful or harmful, magic appears \\nfrequently in the life of an adventurer, and it is the focus \\nof chapters 10 and 11.\\n In the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons, practitioners \\nof magic are rare, set apart from the masses of people \\nby their extraordinary talent. Common folk might see \\nevidence of magic on a regular basis, but it’s usually \\nminor—a fantastic monster, a visibly answered prayer, \\na wizard walking through the streets with an animated \\nshield guardian as a bodyguard.\\n For adventurers, though, magic is key to their survival. \\nWithout the healing magic of clerics and paladins, adven -\\nturers would quickly succumb to their wounds. Without \\nthe uplifting magical support of bards and clerics, war -\\nriors might be overwhelmed by powerful foes. Without \\nthe sheer magical power and versatility of wizards and \\ndruids, every threat would be magnified tenfold.\\n Magic is also a favored tool of villains. Many adven -\\ntures are driven by the machinations of spellcasters who \\nare hellbent on using magic for some ill end. A cult leader \\nseeks to awaken a god who slumbers beneath the sea, a \\nhag kidnaps youths to magically drain them of their vigor, \\na mad wizard labors to invest an army of automatons \\nwith a facsimile of life, a dragon begins a mystical ritual \\nto rise up as a god of destruction—these are just a few \\nof the magical threats that adventurers might face. With \\nmagic of their own, in the form of spells and magic items, \\nthe adventurers might prevail!extras in an adventure. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain \\nwhose agenda drives much of an adventure’s action. \\n Over the course of their adventures, the characters are \\nconfronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situa -\\ntions that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes \\nthe adventurers and other creatures do their best to \\nkill or capture each other in combat. At other times, the \\nadventurers talk to another creature (or even a magical \\nobject) with a goal in mind. And often, the adventurers \\nspend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, \\nfind something hidden, or unravel the current situation. \\nMeanwhile, the adventurers explore the world, making \\ndecisions about which way to travel and what they’ll try \\nto do next.\\n Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short ad -\\nventure might present only a few challenges, and it might \\ntake no more than a single game session to complete. A \\nlong adventure can involve hundreds of combats, interac -\\ntions, and other challenges, and take dozens of sessions \\nto play through, stretching over weeks or months of real \\ntime. Usually, the end of an adventure is marked by the \\nadventurers heading back to civilization to rest and enjoy \\nthe spoils of their labors.\\n But that’s not the end of the story. You can think of \\nan adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made \\nup of multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole \\nseries—a string of adventures joined together, with a con -\\nsistent group of adventurers following the narrative from \\nstart to finish.\\nThe Three Pillars of Adventure\\nAdventurers can try to do anything their players can \\nimagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activities \\nin three broad categories: exploration, social interaction, \\nand combat.\\n Exploration includes both the adventurers’ movement \\nthrough the world and their interaction with objects and \\nsituations that require their attention. Exploration is the \\ngive-and-take of the players describing what they want \\ntheir characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling \\nthe players what happens as a result. On a large scale, \\nthat might involve the characters spending a day crossing \\na rolling plain or an hour making their way through cav -\\nerns underground. On the smallest scale, it could mean \\none character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to see \\nwhat happens.\\n Social interaction features the adventurers talking to \\nsomeone (or something) else. It might mean demanding \\nthat a captured scout reveal the secret entrance to the \\ngoblin lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner, \\npleading for mercy from an orc chieftain, or persuading \\na talkative magic mirror to show a distant location to the \\nadventurers.\\n The rules in chapters 7 and 8 support exploration and \\nsocial interaction, as do many class features in chapter 3 \\nand personality traits in chapter 4.\\n Combat , the focus of chapter 9, involves characters \\nand other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells, \\nmaneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort RICHARD WHITTERS'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Note these in -\\ncreases and remember to apply them later.\\n Record the traits granted by your race on your \\ncharacter sheet. Be sure to note your starting \\nlanguages and your base speed as well.\\nBuilding Bruenor, Step 1\\nBob is sitting down to create his character. He decides \\nthat a gruff mountain dwarf fits the character he wants \\nto play. He notes all the racial traits of dwarves on his \\ncharacter sheet, including his speed of 25 feet and the \\nlanguages he knows: Common and Dwarvish.\\n2. Choose a Class\\nEvery adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly \\ndescribes a character’s vocation, what special talents he \\nor she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely \\nto employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, \\nor engaging in a tense negotiation. The character classes \\nare described in chapter 3.\\n Your character receives a number of benefits from \\nyour choice of class. Many of these benefits are class \\nfeatures —capabilities (including spellcasting) that set \\nyour character apart from members of other classes. You \\nalso gain a number of proficiencies : armor, weapons, \\nskills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your profi -\\nciencies define many of the things your character can do \\nparticularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a \\nconvincing lie.\\n On your character sheet, record all the features that \\nyour class gives you at 1st level.\\nLevel\\nTypically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in \\nlevel by adventuring and gaining experience points (XP). \\nA 1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring \\nworld, although he or she might have been a soldier or a \\npirate and done dangerous things before.\\n Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s en -\\ntry into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar \\nwith the game, or if you are joining an existing D&D \\ncampaign, your DM might decide to have you begin at a \\nhigher level, on the assumption that your character has \\nalready survived a few harrowing adventures.\\n Record your level on your character sheet. If you’re \\nstarting at a higher level, record the additional elements \\nyour class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also re -\\ncord your experience points. A 1st-level character has \\n0 XP. A higher-level character typically begins with the \\nminimum amount of XP required to reach that level \\n(see “Beyond 1st Level” later in this chapter).\\nHit Points and Hit Dice\\nYour character’s hit points define how tough your char -\\nacter is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your \\nhit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit \\nPoint Dice).Your first step in playing an adventurer in the \\nDungeons & Dragons game is to imagine and create a \\ncharacter of your own. Your character is a combination \\nof game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagina -\\ntion. You choose a race (such as human or halfling) and \\na class (such as fighter or wizard). You also invent the \\npersonality, appearance, and backstory of your character. \\nOnce completed, your character serves as your repre -\\nsentative in the game, your avatar in the Dungeons & \\nDragons  world.\\n Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the \\nkind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a cou -\\nrageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a \\nflamboyant wizard. Or you might be more interested in \\nan unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue \\nwho likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who \\npicks off enemies from afar. Do you like fantasy fiction \\nfeaturing dwarves or elves? Try building a character of \\none of those races. Do you want your character to be the \\ntoughest adventurer at the table? Consider the fighter \\nclass. If you don’t know where else to begin, take a look \\nat the illustrations in this book to see what catches \\nyour interest.\\n Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps \\nin order, making decisions that reflect the character you \\nwant. Your conception of your character might evolve \\nwith each choice you make. What’s important is that you \\ncome to the table with a character you’re excited to play.\\n Throughout this chapter, we use the term character \\nsheet  to mean whatever you use to track your character, \\nwhether it’s a formal character sheet (like the one at the \\nend of these rules), some form of digital record, or a piece \\nof notebook paper. An official D&D character sheet is a \\nfine place to start until you know what information you \\nneed and how you use it during the game.\\nBuilding Bruenor\\nEach step of character creation includes an example of \\nthat step, with a player named Bob building his dwarf \\ncharacter, Bruenor.\\n1. Choose a Race\\nEvery character belongs to a race, one of the many in -\\ntelligent humanoid species in the D&D world. The most \\ncommon player character races are dwarves, elves, \\nhalflings, and humans. Some races also have subraces , \\nsuch as mountain dwarf or wood elf. Chapter 2 provides \\nmore information about these races.\\n The race you choose contributes to your character’s \\nidentity in an important way, by establishing a general \\nappearance and the natural talents gained from culture \\nand ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular ra -\\ncial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain \\nweapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the \\nability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dove -\\ntail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For \\nexample, the racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them \\nexceptional rogues, and high elves tend to be powerful \\nwizards. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too.

Determine Ability Scores\\nMuch of what your character does in the game depends \\non his or her six abilities: Strength , Dexterity , Constitu -\\ntion, Intelligence , Wisdom , and Charisma . Each ability \\nhas a score, which is a number you record on your char -\\nacter sheet.\\n The six abilities and their use in the game are de -\\nscribed in chapter 7. The Ability Score Summary \\ntable provides a quick reference for what qualities are \\nmeasured by each ability, what races increases which \\nabilities, and what classes consider each ability particu -\\nlarly important.\\n You generate your character’s six ability scores  ran-\\ndomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the \\nhighest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five \\nmore times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to \\nsave time or don’t like the idea of randomly determining \\nability scores, you can use the following scores instead: \\n15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.\\n Now take your six numbers and write each number \\nbeside one of your character’s six abilities to assign \\nscores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, \\nWisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to \\nyour ability scores as a result of your race choice.\\n After assigning your ability scores, determine your \\nability modifiers  using the Ability Scores and Modifiers \\ntable. To determine an ability modifier without consulting \\nthe table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide \\nthe result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to \\neach of your scores.\\nBuilding Bruenor, Step 3\\nBob decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, \\n12, 10, 8) for Bruenor’s abilities. Since he’s a fighter, he \\nputs his highest score, 15, in Strength. His next-high -\\nest, 14, goes in Constitution. Bruenor might be a brash \\nfighter, but Bob decides he wants the dwarf to be older, \\nwiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent scores in \\nWisdom and Charisma. After applying his racial ben -\\nefits (increasing Bruenor’s Constitution by 2 and his \\nStrength by 2), Bruenor’s ability scores and modifiers \\nlook like this: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 10 (+0), Con -\\nstitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (–1), Wisdom 13 (+1), \\nCharisma 12 (+1).\\n Bob fills in Bruenor’s final hit points: 10 + his Constitu -\\ntion modifier of +3, for a total of 13 hit points. At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die \\ntype is determined by your class. You start with hit points \\nequal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your \\nclass description. (You also add your Constitution mod -\\nifier, which you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your \\nhit point maximum .\\n Record your character’s hit points on your character \\nsheet. Also record the type of Hit Die your character uses \\nand the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you \\ncan spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see “Resting” in \\nchapter 8).\\nProficiency Bonus\\nThe table that appears in your class description shows \\nyour proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level \\ncharacter. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the \\nnumbers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:\\n• Attack rolls using weapons you’re proficient with\\n• Attack rolls with spells you cast\\n• Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in\\n• Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with\\n• Saving throws you’re proficient in\\n• Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each \\nspellcasting class)\\n Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your \\nsaving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and \\ntool proficiencies. (Skills are described in chapter 7, tools \\nin chapter 5.) Your background gives you additional skill \\nand tool proficiencies, and some races give you more \\nproficiencies. Be sure to note all of these proficiencies, as \\nwell as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.\\n Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die \\nroll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your \\nproficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, \\nfor example) before you apply it. If a circumstance sug -\\ngests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once \\nto the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than \\nonce, you nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only \\nonce, and halve it only once.\\nBuilding Bruenor, Step 2\\nBob imagines Bruenor charging into battle with an axe, \\none horn on his helmet broken off. He makes Bruenor a \\nfighter and notes the fighter’s proficiencies and 1st-level \\nclass features on his character sheet.\\n As a 1st-level fighter, Bruenor has 1 Hit Die—a d10— \\nand starts with hit points equal to 10 + his Constitution \\nmodifier. Bob notes this, and will record the final number \\nafter he determines Bruenor’s Constitution score (see \\nstep 3). Bob also notes the proficiency bonus for a 1st-\\nlevel character, which is +2.Ability Scores and Modifiers\\nScore Modifier\\n1 −5\\n2–3 −4\\n4–5 −3\\n6–7 −2\\n8–9 −1\\n10 –11 +0\\n12–13 +1\\n14–15 +2Score Modifier\\n16 –17 +3\\n18–19 +4\\n20–21 +5\\n22–23 +6\\n24–25 +7\\n26–27 +8\\n28–29 +9\\n30 +10\\nQuick Build\\nEach class description in chapter 3 includes a section \\noffering suggestions to quickly build a character of that \\nclass, including how to assign your highest ability scores, \\na background suitable to the class, and starting spells.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='1010 Chapter 1: Step-by-Step Characters\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Describe Your Character\\nOnce you know the basic game aspects of your character, \\nit’s time to flesh him or her out as a person. Your charac -\\nter needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about \\nwhat he or she looks like and how he or she behaves in \\ngeneral terms.\\n Using the information in chapter 4, you can flesh out \\nyour character’s physical appearance and personality \\ntraits. Choose your character’s alignment  (the moral \\ncompass that guides his or her decisions) and ideals . \\nChapter 4 also helps you identify the things your char -\\nacter holds most dear, called bonds , and the flaws  that \\ncould one day undermine him or her.\\n Your character’s background describes where he or \\nshe came from, his or her original occupation, and the \\ncharacter’s place in the D&D world. Your DM might of -\\nfer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included in \\nchapter 4, and might be willing to work with you to craft \\na background that’s a more precise fit for your charac -\\nter concept.\\n A background gives your character a background \\nfeature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, \\nand it might also give you additional languages or \\nproficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this \\ninformation, along with the personality information \\nyou develop, on your character sheet.\\nYour Character’s Abilities\\nTake your character’s ability scores and race into account \\nas you flesh out his or her appearance and personality. A \\nvery strong character with low Intelligence might think \\nand behave very differently from a very smart character \\nwith low Strength.\\n For example, high Strength usually corresponds \\nwith a burly or athletic body, while a character with \\nlow Strength might be scrawny or plump.\\n A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and \\nslim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either \\ngangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.\\n A character with high Constitution usually looks \\nhealthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A charac -\\nter with low Constitution might be sickly or frail.\\n A character with high Intelligence might be highly \\ninquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intel -\\nligence might speak simply or easily forget details.\\n A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, em -\\npathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on. \\nA character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded, \\nfoolhardy, or oblivious.\\n A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, \\nwhich is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating \\npresence. A character with a low Charisma might come \\nacross as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.Variant: Customizing Ability Scores\\nAt your Dungeon Master’s option, you can use this vari -\\nant for determining your ability scores. The method \\ndescribed here allows you to build a character with a set \\nof ability scores you choose individually.\\n You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The \\ncost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point \\nCost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. \\nUsing this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can \\nend up with, before applying racial increases. You can’t \\nhave a score lower than 8.\\n This method of determining ability scores enables you \\nto create a set of three high numbers and three low ones \\n(15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above aver -\\nage and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of \\nnumbers between those extremes.Ability Score Summary\\nStrength\\nMeasures:  Natural athleticism, bodily power\\nImportant for:  Fighter\\nRacial Increases:\\nMountain dwarf (+2)\\nHuman (+1)\\nDexterity\\nMeasures: Physical agility, reflexes, balance, poise\\nImportant for: Rogue\\nRacial Increases:\\nElf (+2)\\nHalfling (+2)Human (+1)\\nConstitution\\nMeasures: Health, stamina, vital force\\nImportant for: Everyone\\nRacial Increases:\\nDwarf (+2)\\nStout halfling (+1)\\nHuman (+1)\\nIntelligence\\nMeasures: Mental acuity, information recall, analytical skill\\nImportant for:  Wizard\\nRacial Increases:\\nHigh elf (+1)\\nHuman (+1)\\nWisdom\\nMeasures: Awareness, intuition, insight\\nImportant for:  Cleric\\nRacial Increases:\\nHill dwarf (+1)\\nWood elf (+1)Human (+1)\\nCharisma\\nMeasures:  Confidence, eloquence, leadership\\nImportant for:  Leaders and diplomatic characters\\nRacial Increases:\\nLightfoot halfling (+1) Human (+1)'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='1111 Chapter 1: Step-by-Step Characters\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Your character needs to be proficient with armor and \\nshields to wear and use them effectively, and your armor \\nand shield proficiencies are determined by your class. \\nThere are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a \\nshield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in \\nchapter 5.\\n Some spells and class features give you a different way \\nto calculate your AC. If you have multiple features that \\ngive you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose \\nwhich one to use.\\nWeapons\\nFor each weapon your character wields, calculate the \\nmodifier you use when you attack with the weapon and \\nthe damage you deal when you hit.\\n When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll \\na d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you \\nare proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate \\nability modifier.\\n• For attacks with melee weapons , use your Strength \\nmodifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that \\nhas the finesse property, such as a rapier, can use your \\nDexterity modifier instead.\\n• For attacks with ranged weapons, use your Dexterity \\nmodifier for attack and damage rolls. A melee weapon \\nthat has the thrown property, such as a handaxe, can \\nuse your Strength modifier instead.\\nBuilding Bruenor, Step 5\\nBob writes down the starting equipment from the fighter \\nclass and the folk hero background. His starting equip -\\nment includes chain mail and a shield, which combine to \\ngive Bruenor an Armor Class of 18. \\n For Bruenor’s weapons, Bob chooses a battleaxe \\nand two handaxes. His battleaxe is a melee weapon, so \\nBruenor uses his Strength modifier for his attacks and \\ndamage. His attack bonus is his Strength modifier (+3) \\nplus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +5. The bat -\\ntleaxe deals 1d8 slashing damage, and Bruenor adds his \\nStrength modifier to the damage when he hits, for a total \\nof 1d8 + 3 slashing damage. When throwing a handaxe, \\nBruenor has the same attack bonus (handaxes, as thrown \\nweapons, use Strength for attacks and damage), and the \\nweapon deals 1d6 + 3 slashing damage when it hits.\\n6. Come Together\\nMost D&D characters don’t work alone. Each charac -\\nter plays a role within a party , a group of adventurers \\nworking together for a common purpose. Teamwork \\nand cooperation greatly improve your party’s chances \\nto survive the many perils in the worlds of Dungeons & \\nDragons.  Talk to your fellow players and your DM to de -\\ncide whether your characters know one another, how they \\nmet, and what sorts of quests the group might undertake.Building Bruenor, Step 4\\nBob fills in some of Bruenor’s basic details: his name, his \\nsex (male), his height and weight, and his alignment (law -\\nful good). His high Strength and Constitution suggest a \\nhealthy, athletic body, and his low Intelligence suggests a \\ndegree of forgetfulness.\\n Bob decides that Bruenor comes from a noble line, but \\nhis clan was expelled from its homeland when Bruenor \\nwas very young. He grew up working as a smith in the re -\\nmote villages of Icewind Dale. But Bruenor has a heroic \\ndestiny—to reclaim his homeland—so Bob chooses the \\nfolk hero background for his dwarf. He notes the profi -\\nciencies and special feature this background gives him.\\n Bob has a pretty clear picture of Bruenor’s personality \\nin mind, so he skips the personality traits suggested in \\nthe folk hero background, noting instead that Bruenor is \\na caring, sensitive dwarf who genuinely loves his friends \\nand allies, but he hides this soft heart behind a gruff, \\nsnarling demeanor. He chooses the ideal of fairness from \\nthe list in his background, noting that Bruenor believes \\nthat no one is above the law.\\n Given his history, Bruenor’s bond is obvious: he aspires \\nto someday reclaim Mithral Hall, his homeland, from the \\nshadow dragon that drove the dwarves out. His flaw is \\ntied to his caring, sensitive nature—he has a soft spot for \\norphans and wayward souls, leading him to show mercy \\neven when it might not be warranted.\\n5. Choose Equipment\\nYour class and background determine your character’s \\nstarting equipment , including weapons, armor, and \\nother adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your \\ncharacter sheet. All such items are detailed in chapter 5, \\n“Equipment.“\\n Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class \\nand background, you can purchase your starting equip -\\nment. You have a number of gold pieces (gp) to spend \\nbased on your class, as shown in chapter 5. Extensive \\nlists of equipment, with prices, also appear in that chap -\\nter. If you wish, you can also have one trinket at no cost \\n(see the Trinkets table at the end of chapter 5).\\n Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can \\ncarry. Try not to purchase equipment with a total weight \\n(in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times 15. \\nChapter 7 has more information on carrying capacity.\\nArmor Class\\nYour Armor Class (AC) represents how well your \\ncharacter avoids being wounded in battle. Things that \\ncontribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the \\nshield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all \\ncharacters wear armor or carry shields, however.\\n Without armor or a shield, your character’s AC equals \\n10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character \\nwears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your \\nAC using the rules in chapter 5. Record your AC on \\nyour character sheet.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='1212 Chapter 1: Step-by-Step Characters\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Beyond 1st Level\\nAs your character goes on adventures and overcomes \\nchallenges, he or she gains experience, represented by \\nexperience points. A character who reaches a specified \\nexperience point total advances in capability. This ad -\\nvancement is called gaining a level .\\n When your character gains a level, his or her class \\noften grants additional features, as detailed in the class \\ndescription. Some of these features allow you to increase \\nyour ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each \\nor increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an ability \\nscore above 20. In addition, every character’s proficiency \\nbonus increases at certain levels.\\n Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit \\nDie. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier \\nto the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your hit \\npoint maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value \\nshown in your class entry, which is the average result of \\nthe die roll (rounded up).\\n When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your \\nhit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have \\nattained. For example, when Bruenor reaches 8th level as \\na fighter, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to \\n18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to \\n+4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.\\n The Character Advancement table summarizes the \\nXP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through \\nlevel 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that \\nlevel. Consult the information in your character’s class \\ndescription to see what other improvements you gain at \\neach level.\\nTiers of Play\\nThe shading in the Character Advancement table shows the \\nfour tiers of play. The tiers don’t have any rules associated \\nwith them; they are a general description of how the play \\nexperience changes as characters gain levels. In the first tier (levels 1–4), characters are effectively \\napprentice adventurers. They are learning the features \\nthat define them as members of particular classes, in -\\ncluding the major choices that flavor their class features \\nas they advance (such as a wizard’s Arcane Tradition or a \\nfighter’s Martial Archetype). The threats they face are rel -\\natively minor, usually posing a danger to local farmsteads \\nor villages.\\n In the second tier (levels 5–10), characters come into \\ntheir own. Many spellcasters gain access to 3rd-level \\nspells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold \\nof magical power with spells such as fireball  and light -\\nning bolt . At this tier, many weapon-using classes gain \\nthe ability to make multiple attacks in one round. These \\ncharacters have become important, facing dangers that \\nthreaten cities and kingdoms.\\n In the third tier (levels 11–16), characters have reached \\na level of power that sets them high above the ordinary \\npopulace and makes them special even among adven -\\nturers. At 11th level, many spellcasters gain access to \\n6th-level spells, some of which create effects previously \\nimpossible for player characters to achieve. Other charac -\\nters gain features that allow them to make more attacks \\nor do more impressive things with those attacks. These \\nmighty adventurers often confront threats to whole re -\\ngions and continents.\\n At the fourth tier (levels 17–20), characters achieve \\nthe pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic (or \\nvillainous) archetypes in their own right. The fate of the \\nworld or even the fundamental order of the multiverse \\nmight hang in the balance during their adventures.\\nCharacter Advancement\\nExperience Points Level Proficiency Bonus\\n0 1 +2\\n300 2 +2\\n900 3 +2\\n2,700 4 +2\\n6,500 5 +3\\n14,000 6 +3\\n23,000 7 +3\\n34,000 8 +3\\n48,000 9 +4\\n64,000 10 +4\\n85,000 11 +4\\n100,000 12 +4\\n120,000 13 +5\\n140,000 14 +5\\n165,000 15 +5\\n195,000 16 +5\\n225,000 17 +6\\n265,000 18 +6\\n305,000 19 +6\\n355,000 20 +6RICHARD WHITTERS'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content='1313 Chapter 2: Races\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Voices chatter in countless \\ndifferent languages. The smells of cooking in dozens \\nof different cuisines mingle with the odors of crowded \\nstreets and poor sanitation. Buildings in myriad ar -\\nchitectural styles display the diverse origins of their \\ninhabitants.\\n And the people themselves—people of varying size, \\nshape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum of styles \\nand hues—represent many different races, from diminu -\\ntive halflings and stout dwarves to majestically beautiful \\nelves, mingling among a variety of human ethnicities.\\n Scattered among the members of these more common \\nraces are the true exotics: a hulking dragonborn here, \\npushing his way through the crowd, and a sly tiefling \\nthere, lurking in the shadows with mischief in her eyes. A \\ngroup of gnomes laughs as one of them activates a clever \\nwooden toy that moves of its own accord. Half-elves and \\nhalf-orcs live and work alongside humans, without fully \\nbelonging to the races of either of their parents. And \\nthere, well out of the sunlight, is a lone drow—a fugitive \\nfrom the subterranean expanse of the Underdark, try -\\ning to make his way in a world that fears his kind. The \\nPlayer’s Handbook has more information about these \\nunusual races.\\nChoosing a Race\\nHumans are the most common people in the worlds of \\nD&D, but they live and work alongside dwarves, elves, \\nhalflings, and countless other fantastic species. Your \\ncharacter belongs to one of these peoples.\\n Not every intelligent race of the multiverse is appropri -\\nate for a player-controlled adventurer. Dwarves, elves, \\nhalflings, and humans are the most common races to \\nproduce the sort of adventurers who make up typical \\nparties. Other races and subraces are less common as \\nadventurers.\\n Your choice of race affects many different aspects of \\nyour character. It establishes fundamental qualities that \\nexist throughout your character’s adventuring career. \\nWhen making this decision, keep in mind the kind of \\ncharacter you want to play. For example, a halfling could \\nbe a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf makes a \\ntough warrior, and an elf can be a master of arcane magic.\\n Your character race not only affects your ability scores \\nand traits but also provides the cues for building your \\ncharacter’s story. Each race’s description in this chapter \\nincludes information to help you roleplay a character of \\nthat race, including personality, physical appearance, fea -\\ntures of society, and racial alignment tendencies. These \\ndetails are suggestions to help you think about your char -\\nacter; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for \\ntheir race. It’s worthwhile to consider why your character \\nis different, as a helpful way to think about your charac -\\nter’s background and personality.Racial Traits\\nThe description of each race includes racial traits that are \\ncommon to members of that race. The following entries \\nappear among the traits of most races.\\nAbility Score Increase\\nEvery race increases one or more of a character’s abil -\\nity scores.\\nAge\\nThe age entry notes the age when a member of the race \\nis considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected \\nlifespan. This information can help you decide how old \\nyour character is at the start of the game. You can choose \\nany age for your character, which could provide an ex -\\nplanation for some of your ability scores. For example, \\nif you play a young or very old character, your age could \\nexplain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, \\nwhile advanced age could account for a high Intelligence \\nor Wisdom.\\nAlignment\\nMost races have tendencies toward certain alignments, \\ndescribed in this entry. These are not binding for player \\ncharacters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for \\nexample, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you \\nbetter define your character.\\nSize\\nCharacters of most races are Medium, a size category \\nincluding creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Mem -\\nbers of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), \\nwhich means that certain rules of the game affect them \\ndifferently. The most important of these rules is that \\nSmall characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, \\nas explained in chapter 5.\\nSpeed\\nYour speed determines how far you can move when trav -\\neling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9).\\nLanguages\\nBy virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, \\nand write certain languages. Chapter 4 lists the most \\ncommon languages of the D&D multiverse.\\nSubraces\\nSome races have subraces. Members of a subrace have \\nthe traits of the parent race in addition to the traits speci -\\nfied for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary \\nsignificantly from race to race and world to world. In the \\nDragonlance campaign setting, for example, mountain \\ndwarves and hill dwarves live together as different clans \\nof the same people, but in the Forgotten Realms, they live \\nfar apart in separate kingdoms and call themselves shield \\ndwarves and gold dwarves, respectively.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content='1414 Chapter 2: Races\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Bruenor Battlehammer walked up the back of his \\ndead foe, disregarding the fact that the heavy monster lay \\non top of his elven friend. In spite of the added discomfort, \\nthe dwarf’s long, pointed, often-broken nose and gray-\\nstreaked though still-fiery red beard came as a welcome \\nsight to Drizzt. “Knew I’d find ye in trouble if I came out \\nan’ looked for ye!”\\n —R. A. Salvatore, The Crystal Shard\\nKingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the \\nroots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers \\nin deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan \\nand tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs—\\nthese common threads unite all dwarves.\\nShort and Stout\\nBold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, \\nminers, and workers of stone and metal. Though they \\nstand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and \\ncompact that they can weigh as much as a human standing \\nnearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are \\nalso easily a match for any of the larger folk.\\n Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler \\nhue tinged with red, but the most common shades are \\nlight brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. \\nTheir hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually \\nblack, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have \\nred hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and \\ngroom them carefully.\\nLong Memory, Long Grudges\\nDwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the \\noldest living dwarves often remember a very different \\nworld. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living \\nin Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) \\ncan recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when \\norcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile \\nthat lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a \\nperspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as \\nhumans and halflings lack.\\n Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains \\nthey love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic \\nendurance and little change. They respect the traditions \\nof their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the found -\\ning of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the \\nworld, and don’t abandon those traditions lightly. Part of \\nthose traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, \\nwho uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill \\nin battle, and devotion to the forge.\\n Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to \\ntheir word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point \\nof stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of \\njustice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suf -\\nfered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the \\ndwarf’s entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf’s hunt \\nfor vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.Clans and Kingdoms\\nDwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains \\nwhere the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and \\nforge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry \\nof precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves \\nthis love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t \\nfind in their mountains, they gain through trade. They \\ndislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings \\nfrequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water \\nroutes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome \\nin dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits \\neven to them.\\n The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and \\ndwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves \\nwho live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan \\nidentities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and \\ninvoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be \\nclanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.\\n Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, espe -\\ncially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some \\nbecome mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after \\nfor their courage and loyalty.\\nGods, Gold, and Clan\\nDwarves who take up the adventuring life might be \\nmotivated by a desire for treasure—for its own sake, for \\na specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to \\nhelp others. Other dwarves are driven by the command \\nor inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire \\nto bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry \\nare also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to \\nrestore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the \\nclan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after \\nSlow to Trust\\nDwarves get along passably well with most other races. \\n“The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is \\nabout a hundred years,” is a dwarf saying that might be \\nhyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it can be \\nfor a member of a short-lived race like humans to earn a \\ndwarf’s trust.\\n Elves. “It’s not wise to depend on the elves. No telling \\nwhat an elf will do next; when the hammer meets the orc’s \\nhead, they’re as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword. \\nThey’re flighty and frivolous. Two things to be said for them, \\nthough: They don’t have many smiths, but the ones they \\nhave do very fine work. And when orcs or goblins come \\nstreaming down out of the mountains, an elf’s good to have \\nat your back. Not as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no doubt \\nthey hate the orcs as much as we do.”\\n Halflings. “Sure, they’re pleasant folk. But show me \\na halfling hero. An empire, a triumphant army. Even a \\ntreasure for the ages made by halfling hands. Nothing. How \\ncan you take them seriously?”\\n Humans. “You take the time to get to know a human, \\nand by then the human’s on her deathbed. If you’re lucky, \\nshe’s got kin—a daughter or granddaughter, maybe—who’s \\ngot hands and heart as good as hers. That’s when you can \\nmake a human friend. And watch them go! They set their \\nhearts on something, they’ll get it, whether it’s a dragon’s \\nhoard or an empire’s throne. You have to admire that \\nkind of dedication, even if it gets them in trouble more \\noften than not.”'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content='1515 Chapter 2: Races\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and \\nguttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into \\nwhatever other language a dwarf might speak.\\n Subrace.  Two main subraces of dwarves populate the \\nworlds of D&D: hill dwarves and mountain dwarves. \\nChoose one of these subraces.\\nHill Dwarf\\nAs a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and \\nremarkable resilience.

Your hit point maximum \\nincreases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you \\ngain a level.\\nMountain Dwarf\\nAs a mountain dwarf, you’re strong and hardy, accus -\\ntomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. You’re probably \\non the tall side (for a dwarf), and tend toward lighter col -\\noration. The shield dwarves of northern Faerûn, as well \\nas the ruling Hylar clan and the noble Daewar clan of \\nDragonlance, are mountain dwarves.\\n Ability Score Increase.  Your Strength score in -\\ncreases by 2.\\n Dwarven Armor Training.  You have proficiency with \\nlight and medium armor.\\nElf\\n“I have never imagined such beauty existed,”  \\nGoldmoon said softly. The day’s march had been difficult, but \\nthe reward at the end was beyond their dreams.  \\nThe companions stood on a high cliff over the fabled  \\ncity of Qualinost.\\n Four slender spires rose from the city’s corners like glisten-\\ning spindles, their brilliant white stone marbled with shining \\nsilver. Graceful arches, swooping from spire to spire, soared \\nthrough the air. Crafted by ancient dwarven metalsmiths, \\nthey were strong enough to hold the weight of an army, yet \\nthey appeared so delicate that a bird lighting on them might \\noverthrow the balance. These glistening arches were the city’s \\nonly boundaries; there was no wall around Qualinost.

Or a dwarf might search for the axe \\nwielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle \\ncenturies ago.\\nDwarf Names\\nA dwarf’s name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance \\nwith tradition. Every proper dwarven name has been \\nused and reused down through the generations. A \\ndwarf’s name belongs to the clan, not to the individual. \\nA dwarf who misuses or brings shame to a clan name \\nis stripped of the name and forbidden by law to use any \\ndwarven name in its place.\\nMale Names: Adrik, Alberich, Baern, Barendd, Brottor, \\nBruenor, Dain, Darrak, Delg, Eberk, Einkil, Fargrim, \\nFlint, Gardain, Harbek, Kildrak, Morgran, Orsik, \\nOskar, Rangrim, Rurik, Taklinn, Thoradin, Thorin, \\nTordek, Traubon, Travok, Ulfgar, Veit, Vondal\\nFemale Names: Amber, Artin, Audhild, Bardryn, Dagnal, \\nDiesa, Eldeth, Falkrunn, Finellen, Gunnloda, Gurdis, \\nHelja, Hlin, Kathra, Kristryd, Ilde, Liftrasa, Mardred, \\nRiswynn, Sannl, Torbera, Torgga, Vistra\\nClan Names: Balderk, Battlehammer, Brawnanvil, \\nDankil, Fireforge, Frostbeard, Gorunn, Holderhek, \\nIronfist, Loderr, Lutgehr, Rumnaheim, Strakeln, \\nTorunn, Ungart\\nDwarf Traits\\nYour dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abili -\\nties, part and parcel of dwarven nature.\\n Ability Score Increase.  Your Constitution score in -\\ncreases by 2.\\n Age. Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but \\nthey’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. \\nOn average, they live about 350 years.\\n Alignment. Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly \\nin the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend to -\\nward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a \\nbelief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a \\njust order.\\n Size.  Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and aver -\\nage about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.\\n Speed.  Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Exploration and Adventure\\nElves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they \\nare so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration \\nand discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, \\nwhich is regimented from day to day but constantly \\nchanging over decades, so they find careers that let them \\ntravel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy \\nexercising their martial prowess or gaining greater mag -\\nical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some \\nmight join with rebels fighting against oppression, and \\nothers might become champions of moral causes.\\nElf Names\\nElves are considered children until they declare them -\\nselves adults, some time after the hundredth birthday, \\nand before this period they are called by child names.\\n On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, \\nalthough those who knew him or her as a youngster \\nmight continue to use the child name. Each elf’s adult \\nname is a unique creation, though it might reflect the \\nnames of respected individuals or other family members. \\nLittle distinction exists between male names and \\nfemale names; the groupings here reflect only general \\ntendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, \\ntypically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves \\ntraveling among humans translate their family names \\ninto Common, but others retain the Elvish version.\\nChild Names:  Ara, Bryn, Del, Eryn, Faen, Innil, \\nLael, Mella, Naill, Naeris, Phann, Rael, Rinn, Sai, \\nSyllin, Thia, Vall\\nMale Adult Names: Adran, Aelar, Aramil, Arannis, \\nAust, Beiro, Berrian, Carric, Enialis, Erdan, Erevan, \\nGalinndan, Hadarai, Heian, Himo, Immeral, Ivellios, \\nLaucian, Mindartis, Paelias, Peren, Quarion, Riardon, \\nRolen, Soveliss, Thamior, Tharivol, Theren, Varis\\nFemale Adult Names: Adrie, Althaea, Anastrianna, \\nAndraste, Antinua, Bethrynna, Birel, Caelynn, Drusilia, \\nEnna, Felosial, Ielenia, Jelenneth, Keyleth, Leshanna, \\nLia, Meriele, Mialee, Naivara, Quelenna, Quillathe, \\nSariel, Shanairra, Shava, Silaqui, Theirastra, Thia, \\nVadania, Valanthe, XanaphiaElves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living \\nin the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places \\nof ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in \\nsilvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music \\ndrifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the \\nbreeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, mu -\\nsic and poetry, and the good things of the world.\\nSlender and Graceful\\nWith their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear \\nhauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many \\nother races. They are slightly shorter than humans on \\naverage, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over \\n6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing \\nonly 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about \\nthe same height, and males are only marginally heavier \\nthan females.\\n Elves’ coloration encompasses the normal human \\nrange and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, \\nand almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes \\nlike pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and \\nlittle body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright col -\\nors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.\\nA Timeless Perspective\\nElves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad \\nperspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived \\nraces more deeply. They are more often amused than \\nexcited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They \\ntend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. \\nWhen pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring \\non a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be \\nfocused and relentless. They are slow to make friends \\nand enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply \\nto petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with \\nvengeance.\\n Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible \\nin the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and com -\\npromise to resolve differences before they escalate to \\nviolence. They have been known to retreat from intru -\\nsions into their woodland homes, confident that they can \\nsimply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, \\nelves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with \\nsword, bow, and strategy.\\nHidden Woodland Realms\\nMost elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among \\nthe trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vege -\\ntables, and their skill and magic allow them to support \\nthemselves without the need for clearing and plowing \\nland. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked \\nclothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is \\nusually limited, though a few elves make a good living by \\ntrading crafted items for metals (which they have no inter -\\nest in mining).\\n Elves encountered outside their own lands are com -\\nmonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human \\nnobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach \\nswordplay or magic to their children.\\nHaughty but Gracious\\nAlthough they can be haughty, elves are generally gracious \\neven to those who fall short of their high expectations—\\nwhich is most non-elves. Still, they can find good in just \\nabout anyone.\\n Dwarves. “Dwarves are dull, clumsy oafs. But what they \\nlack in humor, sophistication, and manners, they make up \\nin valor. And I must admit, their best smiths produce art \\nthat approaches elven quality.”\\n Halflings. “Halflings are people of simple pleasures, and \\nthat is not a quality to scorn. They’re good folk, they care \\nfor each other and tend their gardens, and they have proven \\nthemselves tougher than they seem when the need arises.”\\n Humans. “All that haste, their ambition and drive to \\naccomplish something before their brief lives pass away—\\nhuman endeavors seem so futile sometimes. But then \\nyou look at what they have accomplished, and you have to \\nappreciate their achievements. If only they could slow down \\nand learn some refinement.”'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='1717 Chapter 2: Races\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Ancient divides among the elven people re -\\nsulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, \\nand dark elves, who are commonly called drow. This \\ndocument presents two of these subraces to choose \\nfrom. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still \\nfurther (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the \\nForgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a nar -\\nrower subrace.\\nHigh Elf\\nAs a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of \\nat least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of \\nD&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which \\nincludes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, \\nthe Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the \\nForgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing \\nthemselves to be superior to non-elves and even other \\nelves. The other type (including the high elves of Grey -\\nhawk, the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves \\nof the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more \\nfriendly, and often encountered among humans and \\nother races.\\n The sun elves of Faerûn (also called gold elves or sun -\\nrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, \\nor golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. \\nMoon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are \\nmuch paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with \\nblue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, \\nbut various shades of blond, brown, and red are not \\nuncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked \\nwith gold.\\n Ability Score Increase.  Your Intelligence score in -\\ncreases by 1.\\n Elf Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the \\nlongsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.\\n Cantrip.  You know one cantrip of your choice from the \\nwizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting abil -\\nity for it.\\n Extra Language. You can speak, read, and write one \\nextra language of your choice.\\nWood Elf\\nAs a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and \\nyour fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through \\nyour native forests. This category includes the wild elves \\n(grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragon -\\nlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk \\nand the Forgotten Realms. In Faerûn, wood elves (also \\ncalled wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclu -\\nsive and distrusting of non-elves.\\n Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, some -\\ntimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward \\nbrowns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or cop -\\nper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.\\n Ability Score Increase.  Your Wisdom score in -\\ncreases by 1.\\n Elf Weapon Training.  You have proficiency with the \\nlongsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.\\n Fleet of Foot. Your base walking speed increases \\nto 35 feet.\\n Mask of the Wild. You can attempt to hide even when \\nyou are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, fall -\\ning snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.Family Names (Common Translations):  Amakiir \\n(Gemflower), Amastacia (Starflower), Galanodel \\n(Moonwhisper), Holimion (Diamonddew), Ilphelkiir \\n(Gemblossom), Liadon (Silverfrond), Meliamne \\n(Oakenheel), Naïlo (Nightbreeze), Siannodel \\n(Moonbrook), Xiloscient (Goldpetal)\\nElf Traits\\nYour elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the \\nresult of thousands of years of elven refinement.\\n Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score in -\\ncreases by 2.\\n Age.  Although elves reach physical maturity at about \\nthe same age as humans, the elven understanding of \\nadulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass \\nworldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood \\nand an adult name around the age of 100 and can live \\nto be 750 years old.\\n Alignment.  Elves love freedom, variety, and self-ex -\\npression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects \\nof chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well \\nas their own, and they are more often good than not.\\n Size.  Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and \\nhave slender builds. Your size is Medium.\\n Speed.  Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\\n Darkvision.  Accustomed to twilit forests and the night \\nsky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. \\nYou can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were \\nbright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You \\ncan’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\\n Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Percep -\\ntion skill.\\n Fey Ancestry.  You have advantage on saving throws \\nagainst being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.\\n Trance.  Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they medi -\\ntate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. \\n(The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) \\nWhile meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such \\ndreams are actually mental exercises that have become \\nreflexive through years of practice. After resting in this \\nway, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 \\nhours of sleep.\\n Languages.  You can speak, read, and write Common \\nand Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and \\nintricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and \\ntheir songs and poems are famous among other races. \\nMany bards learn their language so they can add Elvish \\nballads to their repertoires.\\nThe Darkness of the Drow\\nWere it not for one renowned exception, the race of drow \\nwould be universally reviled. Their depraved society is \\npreoccupied with the favor of Lolth, their spider-goddess, \\nwho sanctions murder and the extermination of entire \\nfamilies as noble houses vie for position. Drow grow \\nup believing that surface-dwelling races are worthless \\nexcept as slaves.\\n Yet one drow, at least, broke the mold.

They are generous, happily sharing \\nwhat they have even in lean times.\\nBlend into the Crowd\\nHalflings are adept at fitting into a community of hu -\\nmans, dwarves, or elves, making themselves valuable \\nand welcome. The combination of their inherent stealth \\nand their unassuming nature helps halflings to avoid un -\\nwanted attention.\\n Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal \\nto their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can \\ndisplay remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, \\nor communities are threatened.\\nPastoral Pleasantries\\nMost halflings live in small, peaceful communities with \\nlarge farms and well-kept groves. They rarely build \\nkingdoms of their own or even hold much land beyond \\ntheir quiet shires. They typically don’t recognize any sort \\nof halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to family \\nelders to guide them. Families preserve their traditional \\nways despite the rise and fall of empires.\\n Many halflings live among other races, where the \\nhalflings’ hard work and loyal outlook offer them abun -\\ndant rewards and creature comforts. Some halfling \\ncommunities travel as a way of life, driving wagons or \\nguiding boats from place to place and maintaining no \\npermanent home.\\nExploring Opportunities\\nHalflings usually set out on the adventurer’s path to de -\\nfend their communities, support their friends, or explore \\na wide and wonder-filled world. For them, adventuring \\nis less a career than an opportunity or sometimes a \\nnecessity.\\nHalfling Names\\nA halfling has a given name, a family name, and possibly \\na nickname. Family names are often nicknames that \\nstuck so tenaciously they have been passed down through \\nthe generations.\\nMale Names: Alton, Ander, Cade, Corrin, Eldon, Errich, \\nFinnan, Garret, Lindal, Lyle, Merric, Milo, Osborn, \\nPerrin, Reed, Roscoe, Wellby\\nFemale Names: Andry, Bree, Callie, Cora, Euphemia, \\nJillian, Kithri, Lavinia, Lidda, Merla, Nedda, Paela, \\nPortia, Seraphina, Shaena, Trym, Vani, Verna\\nFamily Names:  Brushgather, Goodbarrel, Greenbottle, \\nHigh-hill, Hilltopple, Leagallow, Tealeaf, Thorngage, \\nTosscobble, Underbough\\nHalfling Traits\\nYour halfling character has a number of traits in common \\nwith all other halflings.\\n Ability Score Increase.  Your Dexterity score in -\\ncreases by 2.\\n Age. A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 \\nand generally lives into the middle of his or her sec -\\nond century.Halfling\\nRegis the halfling, the only one of his kind for \\nhundreds of miles in any direction, locked his fingers behind \\nhis head and leaned back against the mossy blanket of the \\ntree trunk. Regis was short, even by the standards of his \\ndiminutive race, with the fluff of his curly brown locks barely \\ncresting the three-foot mark, but his belly was amply thick -\\nened by his love of a good meal, or several, as the opportu-\\nnities presented themselves. The crooked stick that served as \\nhis fishing pole rose up above him, clenched between two of \\nhis toes, and hung out over the quiet lake, mirrored perfectly \\nin the glassy surface of Maer Dualdon.\\n —R.A. Salvatore, The Crystal Shard\\nThe comforts of home are the goals of most halflings’ \\nlives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from ma -\\nrauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire \\nand a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. \\nThough some halflings live out their days in remote ag -\\nricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that \\ntravel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide \\nhorizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peo -\\nples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, \\nand home, though home might be a wagon jostling along \\nan dirt road or a raft floating downriver.\\nSmall and Practical\\nThe diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger \\ncreatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding \\noffense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively \\nharmless and so have managed to survive for centuries \\nin the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and \\npolitical strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing \\nbetween 40 and 45 pounds.\\n Halflings’ skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy \\ncast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown and \\nwavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often \\nsport long sideburns, but beards are rare among them \\nand mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, \\ncomfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors.\\n Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. \\nThey’re concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures \\nand have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest \\nof halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather \\nthan on display for all to see. They have  \\na knack for finding the most straightforward solution  \\nto a problem, and have little patience for dithering.\\nKind and Curious\\nHalflings are an affable and cheerful people. They \\ncherish the bonds of family and friendship as well \\nas the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few \\ndreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among \\nthem usually venture into the world for reasons of \\ncommunity, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They \\nlove discovering new things, even simple things, such \\nas an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content='1919 Chapter 2: Races\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Yet there was an energy, \\na love of adventure, that sang from every page. Long into the \\nnight Liriel read, lighting candle after precious candle.\\n She’d never given much thought to humans, but these sto-\\nries fascinated her. In these yellowed pages were tales of bold \\nheroes, strange and fierce animals, mighty primitive gods, and \\na magic that was part and fabric of that distant land.\\n —Elaine Cunningham, Daughter of the Drow\\nIn the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the young -\\nest of the common races, late to arrive on the world scene \\nand short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and \\ndragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that \\nthey strive to achieve as much as they can in the years \\nthey are given. Or maybe they feel they have something \\nto prove to the elder races, and that’s why they build their \\nmighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. \\nWhatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the \\nachievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.\\nA Broad Spectrum\\nWith their penchant for migration and conquest, humans \\nare more physically diverse than other common races. \\nThere is no typical human. An individual can stand from \\n5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 \\npounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black \\nto very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, \\nkinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is \\nsparse or thick. A lot of humans have a dash of nonhu -\\nman blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or other lineages. \\nHumans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely \\nlive even a single century. Alignment.  Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, \\nthey are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in \\npain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are \\nalso very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on \\nthe support of their community and the comfort of \\ntheir old ways.\\n Size.  Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh \\nabout 40 pounds. Your size is Small.\\n Speed.  Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\\n Lucky.  When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, \\nability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and \\nmust use the new roll.\\n Brave.  You have advantage on saving throws against \\nbeing frightened.\\n Halfling Nimbleness. You can move through the space \\nof any creature that is of a size larger than yours.\\n Languages.  You can speak, read, and write Common \\nand Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but \\nhalflings are loath to share it with others. They write \\nvery little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. \\nTheir oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all \\nhalflings speak Common to converse with the people \\nin whose lands they dwell or through which they are \\ntraveling.\\n Subrace.  The two main kinds of halfling, lightfoot and \\nstout, are more like closely related families than true sub -\\nraces. Choose one of these subraces.\\nLightfoot\\nAs a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, \\neven using other people as cover. You’re inclined to be \\naffable and get along well with others. In the Forgotten \\nRealms, lightfoot halflings have spread the farthest and \\nthus are the most common variety.\\n Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other hal -\\nflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take up a \\nnomadic life. In the world of Greyhawk, these halflings \\nare called hairfeet or tallfellows.\\n Ability Score Increase.  Your Charisma score in -\\ncreases by 1.\\n Naturally Stealthy.  You can attempt to hide even when \\nyou are obscured only by a creature that is at least one \\nsize larger than you.\\nStout\\nAs a stout halfling, you’re hardier than average and have \\nsome resistance to poison. Some say that stouts have \\ndwarven blood. In the Forgotten Realms, these halflings \\nare called stronghearts, and they’re most common in \\nthe south.\\n Ability Score Increase.  Your Constitution score in -\\ncreases by 1.\\n Stout Resilience.  You have advantage on saving \\nthrows against poison, and you have resistance against \\npoison damage.\\nAffable and Positive\\nHalflings try to get along with everyone else and are loath to \\nmake sweeping generalizations—especially negative ones.\\n Dwarves. “Dwarves make loyal friends, and you can count \\non them to keep their word. But would it hurt them to smile \\nonce in a while?”\\n Elves. “They’re so beautiful! Their faces, their music, \\ntheir grace and all. It’s like they stepped out of a wonderful \\ndream. But there’s no telling what’s going on behind their \\nsmiling faces—surely more than they ever let on.”\\n Humans. “Humans are a lot like us, really. At least some \\nof them are. Step out of the castles and keeps, go talk to \\nthe farmers and herders and you’ll find good, solid folk. Not \\nthat there’s anything wrong with the barons and soldiers—\\nyou have to admire their conviction. And by protecting their \\nown lands, they protect us as well.”'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content='2020 Chapter 2: Races\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

These groups, \\nand the typical names of their members, can be used as \\ninspiration no matter which world your human is in.\\nCalishite\\nShorter and slighter in build than most other humans, \\nCalishites have dusky brown skin, hair, and eyes. They’re \\nfound primarily in southwest Faerûn.\\nCalishite Names:  (Male) Aseir, Bardeid, Haseid, \\nKhemed, Mehmen, Sudeiman, Zasheir; (female) \\nAtala, Ceidil, Hama, Jasmal, Meilil, Seipora, Yasheira, \\nZasheida; (surnames) Basha, Dumein, Jassan, Khalid, \\nMostana, Pashar, Rein\\nChondathan\\nChondathans are slender, tawny-skinned folk with brown \\nhair that ranges from almost blond to almost black. \\nMost are tall and have green or brown eyes, but these \\ntraits are hardly universal. Humans of Chondathan \\ndescent dominate the central lands of Faerûn, around \\nthe Inner Sea.\\nChondathan Names: (Male) Darvin, Dorn, Evendur, \\nGorstag, Grim, Helm, Malark, Morn, Randal, Stedd; \\n(female) Arveene, Esvele, Jhessail, Kerri, Lureene, Miri, \\nRowan, Shandri, Tessele; (surnames) Amblecrown, \\nBuckman, Dundragon, Evenwood, Greycastle, Tallstag\\nDamaran\\nFound primarily in the northwest of Faerûn, Damarans \\nare of moderate height and build, with skin hues ranging \\nfrom tawny to fair. Their hair is usually brown or black, \\nand their eye color varies widely, though brown is \\nmost common.\\nDamaran Names: (Male) Bor, Fodel, Glar, Grigor, Igan, \\nIvor, Kosef, Mival, Orel, Pavel, Sergor; (female) Alethra, \\nKara, Katernin, Mara, Natali, Olma, Tana, Zora; \\n(surnames) Bersk, Chernin, Dotsk, Kulenov, Marsk, \\nNemetsk, Shemov, StaragVariety in All Things\\nHumans are the most adaptable and ambitious people \\namong the common races. They have widely varying \\ntastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands \\nwhere they have settled. When they settle, though, they \\nstay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great king -\\ndoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual \\nhuman might have a relatively short life span, but a hu -\\nman nation or culture preserves traditions with origins \\nfar beyond the reach of any single human’s memory. They \\nlive fully in the present—making them well suited to the \\nadventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to \\nleave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, hu -\\nmans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to \\nchanging political and social dynamics.\\nLasting Institutions\\nWhere a single elf or dwarf might take on the responsi -\\nbility of guarding a special location or a powerful secret, \\nhumans found sacred orders and institutions for such \\npurposes. While dwarf clans and halfling elders pass on \\nthe ancient traditions to each new generation, human \\ntemples, governments, libraries, and codes of law fix \\ntheir traditions in the bedrock of history. Humans dream \\nof immortality, but (except for those few who seek un -\\ndeath or divine ascension to escape death’s clutches) they \\nachieve it by ensuring that they will be remembered when \\nthey are gone.\\n Although some humans can be xenophobic, in general \\ntheir societies are inclusive. Human lands welcome large \\nnumbers of nonhumans compared to the proportion of \\nhumans who live in nonhuman lands.\\nExemplars of Ambition\\nHumans who seek adventure are the most daring and \\nambitious members of a daring and ambitious race. They \\nseek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows by amassing \\npower, wealth, and fame. More than other people, hu -\\nmans champion causes rather than territories or groups.\\nHuman Names and Ethnicities\\nHaving so much more variety than other cultures, hu -\\nmans as a whole have no typical names. Some human \\nparents give their children names from other languages, \\nsuch as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less \\ncorrectly), but most parents give names that are linked to \\ntheir region’s culture or to the naming traditions of their \\nancestors.\\n The material culture and physical characteristics of \\nhumans can change wildly from region to region. In \\nthe Forgotten Realms, for example, the clothing, archi -\\ntecture, cuisine, music, and literature are different in \\nthe northwestern lands of the Silver Marches than in \\ndistant Turmish or Impiltur to the east—and even more \\ndistinctive in far-off Kara-Tur. Human physical character -\\nistics, though, vary according to the ancient migrations \\nof the earliest humans, so that the humans of the Silver \\nMarches have every possible variation of coloration \\nand features.\\n In the Forgotten Realms, nine human ethnic groups \\nare widely recognized, though over a dozen others are \\nEveryone’s Second-Best Friends\\nJust as readily as they mix with each other, humans mingle \\nwith members of other races. They get along with almost \\neveryone, though they might not be close to many. Humans \\nserve as ambassadors, diplomats, magistrates, merchants, \\nand functionaries of all kinds.\\n Dwarves. “They’re stout folk, stalwart friends, and true to \\ntheir word. Their greed for gold is their downfall, though.”\\n Elves. “It’s best not to wander into elven woods. They \\ndon’t like intruders, and you’ll as likely be bewitched as \\npeppered with arrows. Still, if an elf can get past that \\ndamned racial pride and actually treat you like an equal, you \\ncan learn a lot from them.”\\n Halflings. “It’s hard to beat a meal in a halfling home, \\nas long as you don’t crack your head on the ceiling—good \\nfood and good stories in front of a nice, warm fire. If \\nhalflings had a shred of ambition, they might really amount \\nto something.”'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 20}, page_content='2121 Chapter 2: Races\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

They are heroes, compelled to explore the dark \\nplaces of the world and take on the challenges that lesser \\nwomen and men can’t stand against.\\n Class is the primary definition of what your character \\ncan do. It’s more than a profession; it’s your character’s \\ncalling. Class shapes the way you think about the world \\nand interact with it and your relationship with other peo -\\nple and powers in the multiverse. A fighter, for example, \\nmight view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and \\nmaneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn in a much \\nlarger game. A cleric, by contrast, might see himself as \\na willing servant in a god’s unfolding plan or a conflict \\nbrewing among various deities. While the fighter has con -\\ntacts in a mercenary company or army, the cleric might \\nknow a number of priests, paladins, and devotees who \\nshare his faith.\\n Your class gives you a variety of special features, \\nsuch as a fighter’s mastery of weapons and armor, and \\na wizard’s spells. At low levels, your class gives you \\nonly two or three features, but as you advance in level \\nyou gain more and your existing features often im -\\nprove. Each class entry in this chapter includes a table \\nsummarizing the benefits you gain at every level, and \\na detailed explanation of each one.\\n Adventurers sometimes advance in more than one \\nclass. A rogue might switch direction in life and dab -\\nble in the cleric class while continuing to advance as a \\nrogue. Elves are known to combine martial mastery with \\nmagical training and advance as fighters and wizards \\nsimultaneously. Optional rules for combining classes in \\nthis way, called multiclassing, can be found in the Play -\\ner’s Handbook .\\n Four basic classes—listed in the Classes table—are \\nfound in almost every D&D world and define most typical \\nadventurers.

No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with \\ndivine magic.\\nHealers and Warriors\\nDivine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the \\ngods, flowing from them into the world.

A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient \\nrites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion \\nand an intuitive sense of a deity’s wishes.\\n Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and in -\\nspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. \\nThey can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague \\nor poison, and even call down flames from heaven to con -\\nsume their enemies.

In some cit -\\nies, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a \\nstepping stone to higher positions of authority and involv -\\ning no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare \\nin most hierarchies.\\n When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually \\nbecause his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals \\nof the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the \\nwalls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in \\nancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect \\ntheir deities’ worshipers, which can mean fighting ram -\\npaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, \\nor sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to \\nenter the world.\\n Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to \\nestablished temples and orders of their faiths. A temple \\nmight ask for a cleric’s aid, or a high priest might be in a \\nposition to demand it.\\nCreating a Cleric\\nAs you create a cleric, the most important question to \\nconsider is which deity to serve and what principles you \\nwant your character to embody. The Player’s Handbook \\nincludes lists of many of the gods of the multiverse. \\nCheck with your DM to learn which deities are in \\nyour campaign.\\n Once you’ve chosen a deity, consider your cleric’s rela -\\ntionship to that god.

The Life \\ndomain is detailed at the end of the class description and \\nprovides examples of gods associated with it. See the \\nPlayer’s Handbook for details on all the domains.\\n Your choice grants you domain spells and other fea -\\ntures when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you \\nadditional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain \\nthat feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, \\n8th, and 17th levels.\\nDomain Spells\\nEach domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that \\nyou gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain descrip -\\ntion. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it \\nprepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of \\nspells you can prepare each day.\\n If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the \\ncleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.\\nChannel Divinity\\nAt 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy \\ndirectly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical \\neffects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and \\nan effect determined by your domain. Some domains \\ngrant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as \\nnoted in the domain description.\\n When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which \\neffect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest \\nto use your Channel Divinity again.\\n Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. \\nWhen you use such an effect from this class, the DC \\nequals your cleric spell save DC.\\n Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divin -\\nity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you \\ncan use it three times between rests. When you finish a \\nshort or long rest, you regain your expended uses.\\nChannel Divinity: Turn Undead\\nAs an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a \\nprayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see \\nor hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom \\nsaving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is \\nturned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.\\n A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move \\nas far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move \\nto a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reac -\\ntions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or \\ntry to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. \\nIf there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the \\nDodge action.\\nAbility Score Improvement\\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, \\nand 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your \\nchoice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your \\nchoice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score \\nabove 20 using this feature.• (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or ( b) any \\nsimple weapon\\n• (a) a priest’s pack or ( b) an explorer’s pack\\n• A shield and a holy symbol\\nSpellcasting\\nAs a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. \\nSee chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and \\nchapter 11 for a selection of cleric spells.\\nCantrips\\nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from \\nthe cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips \\nof your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips \\nKnown column of the Cleric table.\\nPreparing and Casting Spells\\nThe Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to \\ncast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one \\nof these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level \\nor higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you \\nfinish a long rest.\\n You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for \\nyou to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you \\ndo so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wis -\\ndom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). \\nThe spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\\n For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four \\n1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of \\n16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of \\n1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the \\n1st-level spell cure wounds , you can cast it using a 1st-\\nlevel or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it \\nfrom your list of prepared spells.\\n You can change your list of prepared spells when you \\nfinish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells \\nrequires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 \\nminute per spell level for each spell on your list.\\nSpellcasting Ability\\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. \\nThe power of your spells comes from your devotion to \\nyour deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell \\nrefers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use \\nyour Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw \\nDC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack \\nroll with one.\\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + \\nyour Wisdom modifier\\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + \\nyour Wisdom modifier\\nRitual Casting\\nYou can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the \\nritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\\nSpellcasting Focus\\nYou can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spell -\\ncasting focus for your cleric spells.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 24}, page_content='2525 Chapter 3: Classes\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile \\ndice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your \\ncleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the \\nnature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or \\ncleric domain spell would be appropriate.\\n If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again \\nfor 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you fin -\\nish a long rest.\\n At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds auto -\\nmatically, no roll required.\\nDivine Domains\\nIn a pantheon, every deity has influence over different \\naspects of mortal life and civilization, called a deity’s \\ndomain. All the domains over which a deity has influence \\nare called the deity’s portfolio. For example, the port -\\nfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the domains of \\nKnowledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you choose one \\naspect of your deity’s portfolio to emphasize, and you are \\ngranted powers related to that domain.\\n Your choice might correspond to a particular sect \\ndedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be \\nworshiped in one region as Phoebus (“radiant”) Apollo, \\nemphasizing his influence over the Light domain, and in \\na different place as Apollo Acesius (“healing”), emphasiz -\\ning his association with the Life domain. Alternatively, \\nyour choice of domain could simply be a matter of per -\\nsonal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals \\nto you most.\\n Each domain’s description gives examples of deities \\nwho have influence over that domain. Gods are included \\nfrom the worlds of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, \\nDragonlance, and Eberron campaign settings, as well as \\nfrom the Celtic, Greek, Norse, and Egyptian pantheons of \\nantiquity.\\nLife Domain\\nThe Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive en -\\nergy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—that \\nsustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and \\nhealth through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and \\nundeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence \\nover this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such \\nas Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as \\nLathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing \\nor endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and \\nDiancecht), and gods of home and community (such as \\nHestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).\\nLife Domain Spells\\nCleric Level Spells\\n1st bless , cure wounds\\n3rd lesser restoration , spiritual weapon\\n5th beacon of hope, revivify\\n7th death ward , guardian of faith\\n9th mass cure wounds , raise dead\\nBonus Proficiency\\nWhen you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain profi -\\nciency with heavy armor.\\nDisciple of Life\\nAlso starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more \\neffective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher \\nto restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains \\nadditional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.\\nChannel Divinity: Preserve Life\\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity \\nto heal the badly injured.\\n As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke \\nhealing energy that can restore a number of hit points \\nequal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures \\nwithin 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among \\nthem. This feature can restore a creature to no more than \\nhalf of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature \\non an undead or a construct.\\nBlessed Healer\\nBeginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on \\nothers heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level \\nor higher that restores hit points to a creature other than \\nyou, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.\\nDivine Strike\\nAt 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon \\nstrikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns \\nwhen you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can \\ncause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to \\nthe target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage \\nincreases to 2d8.\\nSupreme Healing\\nStarting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one \\nor more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead \\nuse the highest number possible for each die. For exam -\\nple, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you \\nrestore 12.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 25}, page_content='2626 Chapter 3: Classes\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Creating a Fighter\\nAs you build your fighter, think about two related ele -\\nments of your character’s background: Where did you get \\nyour combat training, and what set you apart from the \\nmundane warriors around you? Were you particularly \\nruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps \\nbecause of your exceptional dedication? What drove you \\nto this training in the first place? A threat to your home -\\nland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself \\nmight all have been factors.\\n You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s \\narmy or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war \\nacademy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. \\nOr you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. \\nDid you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits \\nof life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tra -\\ndition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? \\nThey might have been military issue or family heirlooms, \\nor perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. \\nYour armaments are now among your most important \\npossessions—the only things that stand between you and \\ndeath’s embrace.\\nQuick Build\\nYou can make a fighter quickly by following these sug -\\ngestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest \\nability score, depending on whether you want to focus \\non melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). \\nYour next-highest score should be Constitution. Second, \\nchoose the soldier background.Fighter\\nA human in clanging plate armor holds her shield before \\nher as she runs toward the massed goblins. An elf behind \\nher, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins \\nwith arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc \\nnearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordi -\\nnate their assault to the best advantage.\\n A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the \\nogre’s club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow \\naside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings \\ntwo scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, \\nlooking for a blind spot in its defenses.\\n A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with \\nhis trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving \\nthem around for the crowd’s delight—and his own tactical \\nadvantage. His opponent’s sword flares with blue light \\nan instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to \\nsmite him.\\n All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most di -\\nverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons & \\nDragons . Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal \\nchampions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, \\nand bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparal -\\nleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough \\nknowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well \\nacquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it \\ndefiantly in the face.\\nWell-Rounded Specialists\\nFighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every \\nfighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a \\nlongsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes \\nin a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter \\nis adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond \\nthat basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes \\nin a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on ar -\\nchery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and \\nsome on augmenting their martial skills with magic. \\nThis combination of broad general ability and exten -\\nsive specialization makes fighters superior combatants \\non battlefields and in dungeons alike.\\nTrained for Danger\\nNot every member of the city watch, the village militia, \\nor the queen’s army is a fighter. Most of these troops are \\nrelatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic \\ncombat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers, \\ntrained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar fig -\\nures are fighters.\\n Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adven -\\nturers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other \\ndangerous work common among adventurers is second \\nnature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he \\nor she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but \\nalso much greater rewards—few fighters in the city watch \\nhave the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue  \\nsword, for example.The Fighter\\nLevelProficiency\\nBonus Features\\n1st +2 Fighting Style, Second Wind\\n2nd +2 Action Surge (one use)\\n3rd +2 Martial Archetype\\n4th +2 Ability Score Improvement\\n5th +3 Extra Attack\\n6th +3 Ability Score Improvement\\n7th +3 Martial Archetype feature\\n8th +3 Ability Score Improvement\\n9th +4 Indomitable (one use)\\n10th +4 Martial Archetype feature\\n11th +4 Extra Attack (2)\\n12th +4 Ability Score Improvement\\n13th +5 Indomitable (two uses)\\n14th +5 Ability Score Improvement\\n15th +5 Martial Archetype feature\\n16th +5 Ability Score Improvement\\n17th +6 Action Surge (two uses), Indomitable \\n(three uses)\\n18th +6 Martial Archetype feature\\n19th +6 Ability Score Improvement\\n20th +6 Extra Attack (3)'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content='2727 Chapter 3: Classes\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

She presses an ear \\nto the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the \\nlock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the \\nshadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the \\ndoor open.\\n A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his \\naccomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When \\ntheir target—a notorious slaver—passes the alleyway, \\nthe accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, \\nand the assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can \\nmake a sound.\\n Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and \\nmagically lifts the key ring from the guard’s belt. In a mo -\\nment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and \\nshe and her companions are free to make their escape.\\n Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabil -\\nities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a \\nknack for finding the solution to just about any problem, \\ndemonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is \\nthe cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.\\nSkill and Precision\\nRogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of \\na variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat \\nabilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other \\ncharacters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and \\ndeception, while others refine the skills that help them \\nin a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and \\ndisarming traps, and opening locks.\\n When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning \\nover brute strength. A rogue would rather make one \\nprecise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will \\nhurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a \\nbarrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural \\nknack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks \\nto supplement their other abilities.\\nA Shady Living\\nEvery town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them \\nlive up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a \\nliving as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con art -\\nists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves’ \\nguilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate inde -\\npendently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to \\nhelp them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make \\nan honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or extermi -\\nnators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where \\ndire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.\\n As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. \\nSome are hardened criminals who decide to seek their \\nfortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of \\nadventure to escape from the law. Some have learned \\nand perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of \\ninfiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search \\nof treasure.\\nCreating a Rogue\\nAs you create your rogue character, consider the char -\\nacter’s relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal Martial Archetypes\\nDifferent fighters choose different approaches to perfect -\\ning their fighting prowess.

At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points \\nequal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no \\nmore than half of your hit points left. You don’t gain this \\nbenefit if you have 0 hit points.RICHARD WHITTERS'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 28}, page_content='2929 Chapter 3: Classes\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficien -\\ncies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.\\nSneak Attack\\nBeginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and \\nexploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an \\nextra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack \\nif you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must \\nuse a finesse or a ranged weapon.\\n You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another \\nenemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t \\nincapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the \\nattack roll.\\n The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain \\nlevels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column \\nof the Rogue table.\\nThieves’ Cant\\nDuring your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a \\nsecret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to \\nhide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only \\nanother creature that knows thieves’ cant understands \\nsuch messages. It takes four times longer to convey such \\na message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.\\n In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and \\nsymbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as \\nwhether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ \\nguild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in \\nan area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for \\nthieves on the run.past—or present? Are you on the run from the law or \\nfrom an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did you leave \\nyour guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? \\nIs it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some \\nother desire or ideal?\\n What was the trigger that led you away from your pre -\\nvious life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong \\ncause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were \\nlucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you \\nneeded to escape the squalor of your life. Did wander -\\nlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you \\nsuddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your \\nmentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or \\nmaybe you made a new friend—another member of your \\nadventuring party—who showed you new possibilities for \\nearning a living and employing your particular talents.\\nQuick Build\\nYou can make a rogue quickly by following these sug -\\ngestions.

If your attack misses a target within \\nrange, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if \\nyou fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.\\n Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until \\nyou finish a short or long rest.\\nRoguish Archetypes\\nRogues have many features in common, including their \\nemphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and \\ndeadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick \\nreflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in vary -\\ning directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your \\nchoice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not \\nnecessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a \\ndescription of your preferred techniques.\\nThief\\nYou hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, \\nbandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow \\nthis archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of \\nthemselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, \\ndelvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your \\nagility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into \\nancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using \\nmagic items you normally couldn’t employ.\\nFast Hands\\nStarting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action \\ngranted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity \\n(Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm \\na trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.\\nSecond-Story Work\\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the \\nability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer \\ncosts you extra movement.\\n In addition, when you make a running jump, the dis -\\ntance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to \\nyour Dexterity modifier.\\nSupreme Sneak\\nStarting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity \\n(Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed \\non the same turn.\\nUse Magic Device\\nBy 13th level, you have learned enough about the work -\\nings of magic that you can improvise the use of items \\neven when they are not intended for you. You ignore \\nall class, race, and level requirements on the use of \\nmagic items.\\nThief’s Reflexes\\nWhen you reach 17th level, you have become adept at lay -\\ning ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take \\ntwo turns during the first round of any combat. You take \\nyour first turn at your normal initiative and your second \\nturn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature \\nwhen you are surprised.Cunning Action\\nStarting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility \\nallow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus \\naction on each of your turns in combat. This action can \\nbe used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.\\nRoguish Archetype\\nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in \\nthe exercise of your rogue abilities. The Thief archetype \\nis detailed here; see the Player’s Handbook for other ar -\\nchetypes. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and \\nthen again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.\\nAbility Score Improvement\\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, \\n16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of \\nyour choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of \\nyour choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability \\nscore above 20 using this feature.\\nUncanny Dodge\\nStarting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see \\nhits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve \\nthe attack’s damage against you.\\nEvasion\\nBeginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the \\nway of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery \\nbreath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected \\nto an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving \\nthrow to take only half damage, you instead take no \\ndamage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half \\ndamage if you fail.\\nReliable Talent\\nBy 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until \\nthey approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability \\ncheck that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can \\ntreat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.\\nBlindsense\\nStarting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are \\naware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature \\nwithin 10 feet of you.\\nSlippery Mind\\nBy 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. \\nYou gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.\\nElusive\\nBeginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers \\nrarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has \\nadvantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 30}, page_content='3131 Chapter 3: Classes\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Fingers weaving in front \\nof her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny bead \\nof fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a con -\\nflagration that engulfs the soldiers.\\n Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes \\nan intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone \\nfloor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and \\ngraceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones \\na long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the cir -\\ncle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly \\nplane beyond.\\n Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a \\ngnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with \\nmystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over \\nthem. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, \\nhe nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the \\npassage to his left.\\n Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united \\nas a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle \\nweave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast \\nspells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, \\nand brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures mon -\\nsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, \\nor turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells \\nchange one substance into another, call meteors down \\nfrom the sky, or open portals to other worlds.Scholars of the Arcane\\nWild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the \\npower of magic draws students who seek to master its \\nmysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shap -\\ning reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell \\nrequires merely the utterance of a few strange words, \\nfleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of \\nexotic materials, these surface components barely hint at \\nthe expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and \\ncountless hours of study.\\n Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is \\nsecondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and \\ngrow in experience. They can also learn them from other \\nwizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from an -\\ncient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.\\nThe Lure of Knowledge\\nWizards’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard \\nis likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage \\nor lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the \\nsecrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell their ser -\\nvices as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives \\nof crime or domination.\\n But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the \\nmost unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their \\nlibraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and \\nlost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts \\nin ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have \\nbeen lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could \\nunlock the path to a power greater than any magic avail -\\nable in the present age.The Wizard\\nLevelProficiency\\nBonus FeaturesCantrips \\nKnown—Spell Slots per Spell Level—\\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th\\n1st +2 Spellcasting, Arcane Recovery 3 2 — — — — — — — —\\n2nd +2 Arcane Tradition 3 3 — — — — — — — —\\n3rd +2 — 3 4 2 — — — — — — —\\n4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 4 4 3 — — — — — — —\\n5th +3 — 4 4 3 2 — — — — — —\\n6th +3 Arcane Tradition feature 4 4 3 3 — — — — — —\\n7th +3 — 4 4 3 3 1 — — — — —\\n8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 4 4 3 3 2 — — — — —\\n9th +4 — 4 4 3 3 3 1 — — — —\\n10th +4 Arcane Tradition feature 5 4 3 3 3 2 — — — —\\n11th +4 — 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 — — —\\n12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 — — —\\n13th +5 — 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 — —\\n14th +5 Arcane Tradition feature 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 — —\\n15th +5 — 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 —\\n16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 —\\n17th +6 — 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1\\n18th +6 Spell Mastery 5 4 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1\\n19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 5 4 3 3 3 3 2 1 1 1\\n20th +6 Signature Spell 5 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 1 1'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 31}, page_content='3232 Chapter 3: Classes\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Creating a Wizard\\nCreating a wizard character demands a backstory dom -\\ninated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your \\ncharacter first come into contact with magic? How did \\nyou discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a \\nnatural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice \\nincessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an \\nancient tome that taught you the basics of magic?\\n What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your \\nfirst taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for \\nmore? Have you received word of a secret repository of \\nknowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard? Per -\\nhaps you’re simply eager to put your newfound magical \\nskills to the test in the face of danger.\\nQuick Build\\nYou can make a wizard quickly by following these sug -\\ngestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability \\nscore, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, \\nchoose the sage background. Third, choose the light , \\nmage hand , and ray of frost cantrips, along with the \\nfollowing 1st-level spells for your spellbook: burning \\nhands , charm person , mage armor , magic missile , shield , \\nand sleep .\\nClass Features\\nAs a wizard, you gain the following class features.\\nHit Points\\nHit Dice: 1d6 per wizard level\\nHit Points at 1st Level: 6 + your Constitution modifier\\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + your \\nConstitution modifier per wizard level after 1st\\nProficiencies\\nArmor:  None\\nWeapons: Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, \\nlight crossbows\\nTools: None\\nSaving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom\\nSkills: Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, \\nInvestigation, Medicine, and Religion\\nEquipment\\nYou start with the following equipment, in addition to the \\nequipment granted by your background:\\n• (a) a quarterstaff or ( b) a dagger\\n• (a) a component pouch or ( b) an arcane focus\\n• (a) a scholar’s pack or ( b) an explorer’s pack\\n• A spellbook\\nSpellcasting\\nAs a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook con -\\ntaining spells that show the first glimmerings of your true \\npower. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcast -\\ning and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.Cantrips\\nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from \\nthe wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips \\nof your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips \\nKnown column of the Wizard table.\\nSpellbook\\nAt 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level \\nwizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repos -\\nitory of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, \\nwhich are fixed in your mind.\\nPreparing and Casting Spells\\nThe Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have \\nto cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast \\none of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s \\nlevel or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when \\nyou finish a long rest. \\n You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available \\nfor you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells \\nfrom your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + \\nyour wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must \\nbe of a level for which you have spell slots.\\n For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have \\nfour 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an In -\\ntelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include \\nsix spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen \\nfrom your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell \\nmagic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-\\nlevel slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your \\nlist of prepared spells.\\n You can change your list of prepared spells when you \\nfinish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells \\nrequires time spent studying your spellbook and mem -\\norizing the incantations and gestures you must make to \\ncast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each \\nspell on your list.\\nSpellcasting Ability\\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard \\nspells, since you learn your spells through dedicated \\nstudy and memorization. You use your Intelligence \\nwhenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In \\naddition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting \\nthe saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when \\nmaking an attack roll with one.\\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + \\nyour Intelligence modifier\\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + \\nyour Intelligence modifier\\nRitual Casting\\nYou can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the \\nritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You \\ndon’t need to have the spell prepared.\\nSpellcasting Focus\\nYou can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a \\nspellcasting focus for your wizard spells.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 32}, page_content='3333 Chapter 3: Classes\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher\\nEach time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wiz -\\nard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each \\nof these spells must be of a level for which you have spell \\nslots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, \\nyou might find other spells that you can add to your spell -\\nbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).\\nArcane Recovery\\nYou have learned to regain some of your magical energy \\nby studying your spellbook. Once per day when you fin -\\nish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to \\nrecover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is \\nequal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), \\nand none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.\\n For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover \\nup to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a \\n2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.Arcane Tradition\\nWhen you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradi -\\ntion, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight \\nschools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchant -\\nment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. \\nThe school of Evocation is detailed at the end of the class \\ndescription; see the Player’s Handbook for information \\non the other schools.\\n Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again \\nat 6th, 10th, and 14th level.\\nAbility Score Improvement\\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, \\nand 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your \\nchoice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your \\nchoice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score \\nabove 20 using this feature.\\nSpell Mastery\\nAt 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over \\ncertain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a \\n1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that \\nare in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their \\nlowest level without expending a spell slot when you have \\nthem prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher \\nlevel, you must expend a spell slot as normal.\\n By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one \\nor both of the spells you chose for different spells of the \\nsame levels.\\nSignature Spells\\nWhen you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two \\npowerful spells and can cast them with little effort. \\nChoose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as \\nyour signature spells. You always have these spells pre -\\npared, they don’t count against the number of spells you \\nhave prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd \\nlevel without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you \\ncan’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\\n If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you \\nmust expend a spell slot as normal.\\nArcane Traditions\\nThe study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the \\nearliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly estab -\\nlished in the worlds of D&D, with various traditions \\ndedicated to its complex study.\\n The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse \\nrevolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through \\nthe ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping \\nthem into eight categories called schools, as described \\nin chapter 10. In some places, these traditions are lit -\\nerally schools. Elsewhere, they are more like academic \\ndepartments, with rival faculties competing for students \\nand funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the \\nsolitude of their own towers use the division of magic \\ninto schools as a learning device, since the spells of each \\nschool require mastery of different techniques.\\nYour Spellbook\\nThe spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels \\nreflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well \\nas intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature \\nof the multiverse. You might find other spells during your \\nadventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll \\nin an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in \\nan ancient library.\\n Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard \\nspell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook \\nif it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare \\nthe time to decipher and copy it.\\n Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing \\nthe basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique \\nsystem of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You \\nmust practice the spell until you understand the sounds \\nor gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook \\nusing your own notation.\\n For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and \\ncosts 50 gp. The cost represents material components you \\nexpend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well \\nas the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent \\nthis time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your \\nother spells.\\n Replacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own \\nspellbook into another book—for example, if you want \\nto make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like \\ncopying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and \\neasier, since you understand your own notation and already \\nknow how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and \\n10 gp for each level of the copied spell.\\n If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same \\nprocedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared \\ninto a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your \\nspellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as \\nnormal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup \\nspellbooks in a safe place.\\n The Book’s Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique \\ncompilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and \\nmargin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume \\nthat you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound \\ngilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a \\nloose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost \\nyour previous spellbook in a mishap.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 33}, page_content='3434 Chapter 3: Classes\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Some \\nevokers find employment in military forces, serving as \\nartillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use \\ntheir spectacular power to protect the weak, while some \\nseek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspir -\\ning tyrants.\\nEvocation Savant\\nBeginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the \\ngold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell \\ninto your spellbook is halved.\\nSculpt Spells\\nBeginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative \\nsafety within the effects of your evocation spells. When \\nyou cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures \\nthat you can see, you can choose a number of them equal \\nto 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automati -\\ncally succeed on their saving throws against the spell, \\nand they take no damage if they would normally take half \\ndamage on a successful save.\\nPotent Cantrip\\nStarting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even \\ncreatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a crea -\\nture succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, \\nthe creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but \\nsuffers no additional effect from the cantrip.\\nEmpowered Evocation\\nBeginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence \\nmodifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation \\nspell you cast.Overchannel\\nStarting at 14th level, you can increase the power of \\nyour simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st \\nthrough 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maxi -\\nmum damage with that spell.\\n The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If \\nyou use this feature again before you finish a long rest, \\nyou take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, \\nimmediately after you cast it. Each time you use this \\nfeature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic \\ndamage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage \\nignores resistance and immunity.RICHARD WHITTERS'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 34}, page_content='3535 Chapter 4: Personality and Background\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only. You don’t need to be confined to binary notions of sex \\nand gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is often seen \\nas androgynous, for example, and some elves in the mul -\\ntiverse are made in Corellon’s image. You could also play \\na female character who presents herself as a man, a man \\nwho feels trapped in a female body, or a bearded female \\ndwarf who hates being mistaken for a male. Likewise, \\nyour character’s sexual orientation is for you to decide.\\nHeight and Weight\\nYou can decide your character’s height and weight, using \\nthe information provided in your race description or on \\nthe Random Height and Weight table. Think about what \\nyour character’s ability scores might say about his or \\nher height and weight. A weak but agile character might \\nbe thin. A strong and tough character might be tall or \\njust heavy.\\n If you want to, you can roll randomly for your charac -\\nter’s height and weight using the Random Height and \\nWeight table. The dice roll given in the Height Modifier \\ncolumn determines the character’s extra height (in \\ninches) beyond the base height. That same number mul -\\ntiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in the Weight \\nModifier column determines the character’s extra weight \\n(in pounds) beyond the base weight.\\nRandom Height and Weight\\nRaceBase\\nHeightHeight\\nModifierBase\\nWeightWeight\\nModifier\\nHuman 4\\'8\" +2d10 110 lb. × (2d4) lb.\\nDwarf, hill 3\\'8\" +2d4 115 lb. × (2d6) lb.\\nDwarf, mountain 4\\' +2d4 130 lb. × (2d6) lb.\\nElf, high 4\\'6\" +2d10 90 lb. × (1d4) lb.\\nElf, wood 4\\'6\" +2d10 100 lb. × (1d4) lb.\\nHalfling 2\\'7\" +2d4 35 lb. × 1 lb.\\nFor example, as a human, Tika has a height of 4 feet 8 \\ninches plus 2d10 inches. Her player rolls 2d10 and gets \\na total of 12, so Tika stands 5 feet 8 inches tall. Then the \\nplayer uses that same roll of 12 and multiplies it by 2d4 \\npounds. Her 2d4 roll is 3, so Tika weighs an extra 36 \\npounds (12 × 3) on top of her base 110 pounds, for a total \\nof 146 pounds.\\nOther Physical Characteristics\\nYou choose your character’s age and the color of his or \\nher hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch of distinctiveness, \\nyou might want to give your character an unusual or \\nmemorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, \\nor a tattoo.\\nAlignment\\nA typical creature in the worlds of Dungeons & Drag -\\nons has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral \\nand personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of \\ntwo factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), \\nand the other describes attitudes toward society and Characters are defined by much more than their \\nrace  and class. They’re individuals with their own stories, \\ninterests, connections, and capabilities beyond those \\nthat class and race define. This chapter expounds on the \\ndetails that distinguish characters from one another, in -\\ncluding the basics of name and physical description, the \\nrules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer points \\nof personality and alignment.\\nCharacter Details\\nYour character’s name and physical description might be \\nthe first things that the other players at the table learn \\nabout you. It’s worth thinking about how these character -\\nistics reflect the character you have in mind.\\nName\\nYour character’s race description includes sample names \\nfor members of that race. Put some thought into your \\nname even if you’re just picking one from a list.\\nSex\\nYou can play a male or female character without gaining \\nany special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your \\ncharacter does or does not conform to the broader cul -\\nture’s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior. \\nFor example, a male drow cleric defies the traditional \\ngender divisions of drow society, which could be a rea -\\nson for your character to leave that society and come to \\nthe surface.Chapter 4: Personality and Background\\nTika and Artemis: Contrasting Characters\\nThe details in this chapter make a big difference in setting \\nyour character apart from every other character. Consider \\nthe following two human fighters.\\n Hailing from the Dragonlance setting, Tika Waylan was a \\nbrash teenager who had a rough childhood. The daughter of \\na thief, she ran away from home and practiced her father’s \\ntrade on the streets of Solace. When she tried to rob the \\nproprietor of the Inn of the Last Home, he caught her and \\ntook her under his wing, giving her a job as a barmaid. But \\nwhen the dragonarmies laid waste to the town of Solace \\nand destroyed the inn, necessity forced Tika into adventure \\nalongside the friends she’d known from her childhood. Her \\nskill as a fighter (a frying pan remains one of her favorite \\nweapons) combined with her history on the streets gave her \\nskills invaluable in her adventuring career.\\n Artemis Entreri grew up on the streets of Calimport in the \\nForgotten Realms. He used his wits, strength, and agility \\nto carve out his own territory in one of the city’s hundreds \\nof poor shanty towns. After several years, he attracted the \\nnotice of one of the most powerful thieves’ guilds in the \\ncity, and he ascended the ranks of the guild quickly despite \\nhis youth. Artemis became the favored assassin of one \\nof the city’s pashas, who sent him to far-off Icewind Dale \\nto recover some stolen gems. He’s a professional killer, \\nconstantly challenging himself to improve his skills.\\n Tika and Artemis are both human and both fighters (with \\nsome experience as rogues), possessing similarly high \\nStrength and Dexterity scores, but there the similarity ends.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 35}, page_content='3636 Chapter 4: Personality and Background\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Sharks \\nare savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; \\nthey have no alignment.\\nLanguages\\nYour race indicates the languages your character can \\nspeak by default, and your background might give you ac -\\ncess to one or more additional languages of your choice. \\nNote these languages on your character sheet.\\n Choose your languages from the Standard Languages \\ntable, or choose one that is common in your campaign. \\nWith your DM’s permission, you can instead choose a \\nlanguage from the Exotic Languages table or a secret lan -\\nguage, such as thieves’ cant or the tongue of druids.\\n Some of these languages are actually families of lan -\\nguages with many dialects. For example, the Primordial \\nlanguage includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran \\ndialects, one for each of the four elemental planes. Crea -\\ntures that speak different dialects of the same language \\ncan communicate with one another.\\nStandard Languages\\nLanguage Typical Speakers Script\\nCommon Humans Common\\nDwarvish Dwarves Dwarvish\\nElvish Elves Elvish\\nGiant Ogres, giants Dwarvish\\nGnomish Gnomes Dwarvish\\nGoblin Goblinoids Dwarvish\\nHalfling Halflings Common\\nOrc Orcs Dwarvish\\nExotic Languages\\nLanguage Typical Speakers Script\\nAbyssal Demons Infernal\\nCelestial Celestials Celestial\\nDeep Speech Mind flayers,  \\nbeholders—\\nDraconic Dragons, \\ndragonbornDraconic\\nInfernal Devils Infernal\\nPrimordial Elementals Dwarvish\\nSylvan Fey creatures Elvish\\nUndercommon Underdark traders Elvishorder (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct \\nalignments define the possible combinations.\\n These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe \\nthe typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. \\nIndividuals might vary significantly from that typical \\nbehavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently \\nfaithful to the precepts of their alignment.\\n Lawful good  (LG) creatures can be counted on to do \\nthe right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, pala -\\ndins, and most dwarves are lawful good.\\n Neutral good  (NG) folk do the best they can to help oth -\\ners according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud \\ngiants, and most gnomes are neutral good.\\n Chaotic good (CG) creatures act as their conscience \\ndirects, with little regard for what others expect. Copper \\ndragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.\\n Lawful neutral  (LN) individuals act in accordance with \\nlaw, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some \\nwizards are lawful neutral.\\n Neutral  (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to \\nsteer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing \\nwhat seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and \\nmany humans are neutral.\\n Chaotic neutral (CN) creatures follow their whims, \\nholding their personal freedom above all else. Many bar -\\nbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.\\n Lawful evil  (LE) creatures methodically take what they \\nwant, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or or -\\nder. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.\\n Neutral evil  (NE) is the alignment of those who do \\nwhatever they can get away with, without compassion or \\nqualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and yugoloths \\nare neutral evil.\\n Chaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, \\nspurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red \\ndragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.\\nAlignment in the Multiverse\\nFor many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral \\nchoice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid \\nraces can choose whether to follow the paths of good or \\nevil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned \\ngods who created these races gave them free will to \\nchoose their moral paths, knowing that good without free \\nwill is slavery.\\n The evil deities who created other races, though, made \\nthose races to serve them. Those races have strong \\ninborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. \\nMost orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc god, \\nGruumsh, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an \\norc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its in -\\nnate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the \\nlingering pull of the orc god’s influence.)\\n Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celes -\\ntials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, \\nand it doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is law -\\nful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful \\nevil, it would cease to be a devil.\\n Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational \\nthought do not have alignments—they are unaligned . \\nTika and Artemis: Alignment\\nTika Waylan is neutral good, fundamentally good-hearted \\nand striving to help others where she can. Artemis is lawful \\nevil, unconcerned with the value of sentient life but at least \\nprofessional in his approach to murder.\\n As an evil character, Artemis is not an ideal adventurer. \\nHe began his career as a villain, and only cooperates with \\nheroes when he must—and when it’s in his own best \\ninterests. In most games, evil adventurers cause problems \\nin groups alongside others who don’t share their interests \\nand objectives. Generally, evil alignments are for villains \\nand monsters.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 36}, page_content='3737 Chapter 4: Personality and Background\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

They can work very much like ideals, driving \\na character’s motivations and goals.\\n Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do \\nyou care most about? To what place do you feel a special \\nconnection? What is your most treasured possession?\\n Your bonds might be tied to your class, your \\nbackground, your race, or some other aspect of your char -\\nacter’s history or personality. You might also gain new \\nbonds over the course of your adventures.\\nFlaws\\nFinally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character’s \\nflaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weak -\\nness—in particular, anything that someone else could \\nexploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against \\nyour best interests. More significant than negative \\npersonality traits, a flaw might answer any of these ques -\\ntions: What enrages you? What’s the one person, concept, \\nor event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?\\nInspiration\\nInspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to re -\\nward you for playing your character in a way that’s true \\nto his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By \\nusing inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait \\nof compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in \\nnegotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let \\nyou call on your bond to the defense of your home village \\nto push past the effect of a spell that has been laid on you.\\nGaining Inspiration\\nYour DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety \\nof reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you play out \\nyour personality traits, give in to the drawbacks pre -\\nsented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your \\ncharacter in a compelling way. Your DM will tell you how \\nyou can earn inspiration in the game.\\n You either have inspiration or you don’t—you can’t \\nstockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.\\nUsing Inspiration\\nIf you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make \\nan attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending \\nyour inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.Personal Characteristics\\nFleshing out your character’s personality—the array of \\ntraits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a \\nperson a unique identity—will help you bring him or her \\nto life as you play the game. Four categories of charac -\\nteristics are presented here: personality traits, ideals, \\nbonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about \\nyour character’s favorite words or phrases, tics and habit -\\nual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you \\ncan imagine.\\n Each background presented later in this chapter in -\\ncludes suggested characteristics that you can use to \\nspark your imagination. You’re not bound to those op -\\ntions, but they’re a good starting point.\\nPersonality Traits\\nGive your character two personality traits. Personality \\ntraits are small, simple ways to help you set your char -\\nacter apart from every other character. Your personality \\ntraits should tell you something interesting and fun about \\nyour character. They should be self-descriptions that are \\nspecific about what makes your character stand out. “I’m \\nsmart” is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of \\ncharacters. “I’ve read every book in Candlekeep” tells you \\nsomething specific about your character’s interests and \\ndisposition.\\n Personality traits might describe the things your char -\\nacter likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your \\ncharacter dislikes or fears, your character’s self-attitude \\nor mannerisms, or the influence of his or her abil -\\nity scores.\\n A useful place to start thinking about personality traits \\nis to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and de -\\nfine one trait related to each. Either one could be positive \\nor negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, \\nfor example, or be cocky about your high score.\\nIdeals\\nDescribe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals \\nare the things that you believe in most strongly, the fun -\\ndamental moral and ethical principles that compel you to \\nact as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life \\ngoals to your core belief system.\\n Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are \\nthe principles that you will never betray? What would \\nprompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act \\nand guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single \\nmost important thing you strive for?\\n You can choose any ideals you like, but your character’s \\nalignment is a good place to start defining them. Each \\nbackground in this chapter includes six suggested ide -\\nals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law, \\nchaos, good, evil, and neutrality. The last one has more \\nto do with the particular background than with moral or \\nethical perspectives.\\nBonds\\nCreate one bond for your character. Bonds represent a \\ncharacter’s connections to people, places, and events in \\nthe world. They tie you to things from your background. \\nThey might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead \\nyou to act against your own best interests if they are \\nTika and Artemis: Character Details\\nConsider how the names Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri \\nset these characters apart from each other and reflect their \\npersonalities. Tika is a young woman determined to prove \\nthat she’s not just a kid any more, and her name makes her \\nsound young and ordinary. Artemis Entreri comes from an \\nexotic land and carries a more mysterious name.\\n Tika is nineteen years old at the start of her adventuring \\ncareer and has auburn hair, green eyes, fair skin with \\nfreckles, and a mole on her right hip. Artemis is a small \\nman, compact and all wiry muscle. He has angular features \\nand high cheekbones, and he always seems in need of a \\nshave. His raven-black hair is thick and full, but his eyes \\nare gray and lifeless—betraying the emptiness of his \\nlife and soul.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 37}, page_content='3838 Chapter 4: Personality and Background\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

How did you learn the skills of your class? \\nWhat sets you apart from ordinary people who share \\nyour background?\\n The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both \\nconcrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) \\nand roleplaying suggestions.\\nProficiencies\\nEach background gives a character proficiency in two \\nskills. Skills are described in chapter 7.\\n In addition, most backgrounds give a character \\nproficiency with one or more tools. Tools and tool profi -\\nciencies are detailed in chapter 5.\\n If a character would gain the same proficiency from \\ntwo different sources, he or she can choose a different \\nproficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.\\nLanguages\\nSome backgrounds also allow characters to learn \\nadditional languages beyond those given by race. \\nSee “Languages” earlier in this chapter.\\nEquipment\\nEach background provides a package of starting equip -\\nment. If you use the optional rule from chapter 5 to spend \\ncoin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment \\nfrom your background.\\nSuggested Characteristics\\nA background contains suggested personal charac -\\nteristics based on your background. You can pick \\ncharacteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or \\nuse the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of \\nyour own creation.\\nCustomizing a Background\\nYou might want to tweak some of the features of a back -\\nground so it better fits your character or the campaign \\nsetting. To customize a background, you can replace \\none feature with any other one, choose any two skills, \\nand choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages \\nfrom the sample backgrounds. You can either use the \\nequipment package from your background or spend coin \\non gear as described in chapter 5. (If you spend coin, you \\ncan’t also take the equipment package suggested for your \\nclass.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, \\none bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that \\nmatches your desired background, work with your DM to \\ncreate one. Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward \\nanother player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or \\nsimply doing something exciting in the game. When \\nanother player character does something that really con -\\ntributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can \\ngive up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.\\nBackgrounds\\nEvery story has a beginning. Your character’s back -\\nground reveals where you came from, how you became \\nan adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter \\nmight have been a courageous knight or a grizzled sol -\\ndier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. \\nYour rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or com -\\nmanded audiences as a jester.\\n Choosing a background provides you with important \\nstory cues about your character’s identity. The most im -\\nportant question to ask about your background is what \\nchanged? Why did you stop doing whatever your back -\\nground describes and start adventuring? Where did you \\nget the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you \\ncome from a wealthy background, why don’t you have \\nTika and Artemis: Personal Characteristics\\nTika and Artemis have distinct personality traits. Tika \\nWaylan dislikes boastfulness and has a fear of heights \\nresulting from a bad fall during her career as a thief. Artemis \\nEntreri is always prepared for the worst and moves with a \\nquick, precise confidence.\\n Consider their ideals. Tika Waylan is innocent, almost \\nchildlike, believing in the value of life and the importance \\nof appreciating everyone. Neutral good in alignment, she \\ncleaves to ideals of life and respect. Artemis Entreri never \\nallows his emotions to master him, and he constantly \\nchallenges himself to improve his skills. His lawful \\nevil alignment gives him ideals of impartiality and a \\nlust for power.\\n Tika Waylan’s bond is to the Inn of the Last Home. \\nThe inn’s proprietor gave her a new chance at life, and \\nher friendship with her adventuring companions was \\nforged during her time working there. Its destruction by \\nthe marauding dragonarmies gives Tika a very personal \\nreason to hate them with a fiery passion. Her bond \\nmight be phrased as “I will do whatever it takes to \\npunish the dragonarmies for the destruction of the Inn of \\nthe Last Home.”\\n Artemis Entreri’s bond is a strange, almost paradoxical \\nrelationship with Drizzt Do’Urden, his equal in swordplay \\nand grim determination. In his first battle with Drizzt, \\nArtemis recognized something of himself in his opponent, \\nsome indication that if his life had gone differently, he \\nmight have led a life more like the heroic drow’s. From that \\nmoment, Artemis is more than a criminal assassin—he \\nis an antihero, driven by his rivalry with Drizzt. His bond \\nmight be phrased as “I will not rest until I have proved \\nmyself better than Drizzt Do’Urden.”\\n Each of these characters also has an important flaw. \\nTika Waylan is naive and emotionally vulnerable, younger \\nthan her companions and annoyed that they still think \\nof her as the kid they knew years ago. She might even be \\ntempted to act against her principles if she’s convinced that \\na particular achievement would demonstrate her maturity. \\nArtemis Entreri is completely walled off from any personal \\nrelationship and just wants to be left alone.\\nTika and Artemis: Backgrounds\\nTika Waylan and Artemis Entreri both lived their earliest \\nyears as street urchins. Tika’s later career as a barmaid \\ndidn’t really change her, so she might choose the urchin \\nbackground, gaining proficiency in the Sleight of Hand and \\nStealth skills, and learning the tools of the thieving trade. \\nArtemis is more defined by his criminal background, giving \\nhim skills in Deception and Stealth, as well as proficiency \\nwith the tools of thievery and poison.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 38}, page_content='3939 Chapter 4: Personality and Background\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

You carry \\na noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, \\nand wields significant political influence. You might be \\na pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discom -\\nfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or \\na disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense \\nof entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working \\nlandowner who cares deeply about the people who live \\nand work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibil -\\nity to them.\\n Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate ti -\\ntle and determine how much authority that title carries. A \\nnoble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an \\nentire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it \\ndown to your own children. Not only do you need to deter -\\nmine your noble title, but you should also work with the \\nDM to describe your family and their influence on you.\\n Is your family old and established, or was your title only \\nrecently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, \\nand over what area? What kind of reputation does your \\nfamily have among the other aristocrats of the region? \\nHow do the common people regard them?\\n What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to \\nthe head of the family? Have you already inherited the ti -\\ntle? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you \\nso far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what \\nyou do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family? How \\ndoes the head of your family feel about your adventuring \\ncareer? Are you in your family’s good graces, or shunned \\nby the rest of your family?\\n Does your family have a coat of arms?

A noble title comes with a pleth -\\nora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles \\n(including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the \\nfamily’s care, or even to the title itself.

A skilled (but not exceptional) \\nartisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is \\nthe standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin \\nitself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss \\ndeals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or \\nthousands of gold pieces, the transactions don’t usually \\ninvolve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold \\npiece is a standard measure of value, and the actual ex -\\nchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.\\n One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most \\nprevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys \\na laborer’s work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a \\nnight’s rest in a poor inn.\\n One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are \\ncommon among laborers and beggars. A single copper \\npiece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.\\n In addition, unusual coins made of other precious met -\\nals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum \\npiece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from \\nfallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes \\narouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transac -\\ntions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a \\nplatinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.\\n A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, \\nso fifty coins weigh a pound.\\nStandard Exchange Rates\\nCoin cp sp ep gp pp\\nCopper (cp) 1 1/10 1/50 1/100 1/1,000\\nSilver (sp) 10 1 1/5 1/10 1/100\\nElectrum (ep) 50 5 1 1/2 1/20\\nGold (gp) 100 10 2 1 1/10\\nPlatinum (pp) 1,000 100 20 10 1\\nSelling Treasure\\nOpportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, \\nweapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. \\nNormally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when \\nyou return to a town or other settlement, provided that you \\ncan find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.\\n Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment. As a general \\nrule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment \\nfetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and \\narmor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condi -\\ntion to sell.\\n Magic Items. Selling magic items is problematic. Find -\\ning someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard, but \\nother items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest \\nnobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, \\nyou won’t normally come across magic items or spells to \\npurchase. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold \\nand should always be treated as such.\\n Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects. These items retain \\ntheir full value in the marketplace, and you can either \\ntrade them in for coin or use them as currency for other \\ntransactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the The marketplace of a large city teems with buyers  \\nand sellers of many sorts: dwarf smiths and elf woodcarv -\\ners, halfling farmers and gnome jewelers, not to mention \\nhumans of every shape, size, and color drawn from a \\nspectrum of nations and cultures. In the largest cities, \\nalmost anything imaginable is offered for sale, from ex -\\notic spices and luxurious clothing to wicker baskets and \\npractical swords.\\n For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons, \\nbackpacks, rope, and similar goods is of paramount \\nimportance, since proper equipment can mean the differ -\\nence between life and death in a dungeon or the untamed \\nwilds. This chapter details the mundane and exotic mer -\\nchandise that adventurers commonly find useful in the face \\nof the threats that the worlds of D&D present.\\nStarting Equipment\\nWhen you create your character, you receive equipment \\nbased on a combination of your class and background. \\nAlternatively, you can start with a number of gold pieces \\nbased on your class and spend them on items from the \\nlists in this chapter. See the Starting Wealth by Class ta -\\nble to determine how much gold you have to spend.\\n You decide how your character came by this starting \\nequipment. It might have been an inheritance, or goods \\nthat the character purchased during his or her upbringing. \\nYou might have been equipped with a weapon, armor, and \\na backpack as part of military service.

Coins, \\ngemstones, trade goods, art objects, animals, and prop -\\nerty can reflect your character’s financial well-being. \\nMembers of the peasantry trade in goods, bartering for \\nwhat they need and paying taxes in grain and cheese. \\nMembers of the nobility trade either in legal rights, such \\nas the rights to a mine, a port, or farmland, or in gold \\nbars, measuring gold by the pound rather than by the \\ncoin. Only merchants, adventurers, and those offering pro -\\nfessional services for hire commonly deal in coins.\\nCoinage\\nCommon coins come in several different denominations \\nbased on the relative worth of the metal from which they \\nare made.

If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in \\nthe Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dex -\\nterity (Stealth) checks.\\n Shields.  A shield is made from wood or metal and is \\ncarried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your \\nArmor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield \\nat a time.\\nLight Armor\\nMade from supple and thin materials, light armor favors \\nagile adventurers since it offers some protection without \\nsacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your \\nDexterity modifier to the base number from your armor \\ntype to determine your Armor Class.\\n Padded. Padded armor consists of quilted layers of \\ncloth and batting.\\n Leather.  The breastplate and shoulder protectors of \\nthis armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by \\nbeing boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer \\nand more flexible materials.\\n Studded Leather. Made from tough but flexible \\nleather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets \\nor spikes.DM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or \\nlarger community first.\\n Trade Goods. On the borderlands, many people con -\\nduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art \\nobjects, trade goods—bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, \\nand so on—retain their full value in the market and can \\nbe used as currency.\\nArmor and Shields\\nD&D  worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many dif -\\nferent cultures, each with its own technology level. For \\nthis reason, adventurers have access to a variety of ar -\\nmor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to \\ncostly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in \\nbetween. The Armor table collects the most commonly \\navailable types of armor found in the game and separates \\nthem into three categories: light armor, medium armor, \\nand heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor \\nwith a shield.\\n The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other \\nproperties of the common types of armor worn in the \\nworlds of D&D.\\n Armor Proficiency. Anyone can put on a suit of armor \\nor strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the \\narmor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. \\nYour class gives you proficiency with certain types of \\narmor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, \\nyou have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, \\nor attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you \\ncan’t cast spells.\\n Armor Class (AC). Armor protects its wearer from at -\\ntacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your \\nbase Armor Class.\\n Heavy Armor. Heavier armor interferes with the wear -\\ner’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the \\nArmor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength \\ncolumn for an armor type, the armor reduces the wear -\\ner’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength \\nscore equal to or higher than the listed score.\\nArmor\\nArmor Cost Armor Class (AC) Strength Stealth Weight\\nLight Armor\\nPadded 5 gp 11 + Dex modifier — Disadvantage 8 lb.\\nLeather 10 gp 11 + Dex modifier — — 10 lb.\\nStudded leather 45 gp 12 + Dex modifier — — 13 lb.\\nMedium Armor\\nHide 10 gp 12 + Dex modifier (max 2) — — 12 lb.\\nChain shirt 50 gp 13 + Dex modifier (max 2) — — 20 lb.\\nScale mail 50 gp 14 + Dex modifier (max 2) — Disadvantage 45 lb.\\nBreastplate 400 gp 14 + Dex modifier (max 2) — — 20 lb.\\nHalf plate 750 gp 15 + Dex modifier (max 2) — Disadvantage 40 lb.\\nHeavy Armor\\nRing mail 30 gp 14 — Disadvantage 40 lb.\\nChain mail 75 gp 16 Str 13 Disadvantage 55 lb.\\nSplint 200 gp 17 Str 15 Disadvantage 60 lb.\\nPlate 1,500 gp 18 Str 15 Disadvantage 65 lb.\\nShield\\nShield 10 gp +2 — — 6 lb.\\nVariant: Equipment Sizes\\nIn most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment \\nthat you find on your adventures, within the bounds of \\ncommon sense. For example, a burly half-orc won’t fit in a \\nhalfling’s leather armor, and a gnome would be swallowed \\nup in a cloud giant’s elegant robe.\\n The DM can impose more realism. For example, a suit \\nof plate armor made for one human might not fit another \\none without significant alterations, and a guard’s uniform \\nmight be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it \\nas a disguise.\\n Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing, \\nand similar items that are made to be worn, they might \\nneed to visit an armorsmith, tailor, leatherworker, or similar \\nexpert to make the item wearable. The cost for such work \\nvaries from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item. \\nThe DM can either roll 1d4 × 10 or determine the increase \\nin cost based on the extent of the alterations required.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 46}, page_content='4747 Chapter 5: Equipment\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your \\nweapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean \\nthe difference between life and death while adventuring.\\n The Weapons table shows the most common weapons \\nused in the worlds of D&D, their price and weight, the \\ndamage they deal when they hit, and any special prop -\\nerties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either \\nmelee or ranged. A melee weapon  is used to attack a \\ntarget within 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged weapon  is \\nused to attack a target at a distance.\\nWeapon Proficiency\\nYour race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency \\nwith certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two \\ncategories are simple  and martial . Most people can \\nuse simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons \\ninclude clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in \\nthe hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including \\nswords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized \\ntraining to use effectively. Most warriors use martial \\nweapons because these weapons put their fighting style \\nand training to best use.\\n Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your pro -\\nficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make \\nwith that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a \\nweapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add \\nyour proficiency bonus to the attack roll.\\nWeapon Properties\\nMany weapons have special properties related to their use, \\nas shown in the Weapons table.\\n Ammunition.  You can use a weapon that has the am -\\nmunition property to make a ranged attack only if you \\nhave ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you \\nattack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammu -\\nnition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or \\nother container is part of the attack (you need a free hand \\nto load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, \\nyou can recover half your expended ammunition by tak -\\ning a minute to search the battlefield.\\n If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to \\nmake a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised \\nweapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the section). \\nA sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used \\nin this way.\\n Finesse.  When making an attack with a finesse \\nweapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexter -\\nity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use \\nthe same modifier for both rolls.Medium Armor\\nMedium armor offers more protection than light armor, \\nbut it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium \\narmor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum \\nof +2, to the base number from your armor type to deter -\\nmine your Armor Class.\\n Hide. This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. \\nIt is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, \\nand other folk who lack access to the tools and materials \\nneeded to create better armor.\\n Chain Shirt.  Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain \\nshirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This \\narmor offers modest protection to the wearer’s upper \\nbody and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against \\none another to be muffled by outer layers.\\n Scale Mail. This armor consists of a coat and leggings \\n(and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with \\noverlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a \\nfish. The suit includes gauntlets.\\n Breastplate.  This armor consists of a fitted metal chest \\npiece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the \\nlegs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides \\ngood protection for the wearer’s vital organs while leav -\\ning the wearer relatively unencumbered.\\n Half Plate. Half plate consists of shaped metal plates \\nthat cover most of the wearer’s body. It does not include \\nleg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached \\nwith leather straps.\\nHeavy Armor\\nOf all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best \\nprotection. These suits of armor cover the entire body \\nand are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only \\nproficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.\\n Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modi -\\nfier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you \\nif your Dexterity modifier is negative.\\n Ring Mail.  This armor is leather armor with heavy \\nrings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor \\nagainst blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior \\nto chain mail, and it’s usually worn only by those who \\ncan’t afford better armor.\\n Chain Mail.  Made of interlocking metal rings, chain \\nmail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath \\nthe mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of \\nblows. The suit includes gauntlets.\\n Splint.  This armor is made of narrow vertical strips \\nof metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over \\ncloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.\\n Plate.  Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal \\nplates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes \\ngauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and \\nthick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles \\nand straps distribute the weight over the body.\\nGetting Into and Out of Armor\\nThe time it takes to don or doff a type of armor or a shield \\nis shown in the Donning and Doffing Armor table.\\n Don. This is the time it takes to put on the item. You \\nbenefit from its AC only if you take the full time to don it.\\n Doff. This is the time it takes to take off the item. If you \\nhave help removing armor, reduce this time by half.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 47}, page_content='4848 Chapter 5: Equipment\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

The first is the weapon’s normal range in \\nfeet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. \\nWhen attacking a target beyond normal range, you have \\ndisadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target \\nbeyond the weapon’s long range.\\n Reach.  This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when \\nyou attack with it, as well as when determining your \\nreach for opportunity attacks with it (see chapter 9).\\n Special.  A weapon with the special property has un -\\nusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s \\ndescription (see “Special Weapons” later in this section). Heavy.  Small creatures have disadvantage on at -\\ntack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size \\nand bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use \\neffectively. \\n Light.  A light weapon is small and easy to handle, mak -\\ning it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. See \\nthe rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9.\\n Loading.  Because of the time required to load this \\nweapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from \\nit when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to \\nfire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can nor -\\nmally make.\\n Range.

Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Adventuring Gear\\nThis section describes items that have special rules or \\nrequire further explanation.\\n Acid. As an action, you can splash the contents of this \\nvial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial \\nup to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make \\na ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the \\nacid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes \\n2d6 acid damage.\\n Alchemist’s Fire. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites \\nwhen exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this \\nflask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged \\nattack against a creature or object, treating the alche -\\nmist’s fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target \\ntakes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A \\ncreature can end this damage by using its action to make \\na DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.\\n Antitoxin.  A creature that drinks this vial of liquid \\ngains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 \\nhour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.\\n Arcane Focus.  An arcane focus is a special item—an \\norb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-\\nlike length of wood, or some similar item—designed to \\nchannel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, \\nor wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus, as \\ndescribed in chapter 10.\\n Ball Bearings. As an action, you can spill these tiny \\nmetal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area \\nthat is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the \\ncovered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving \\nthrow or fall prone. A creature moving through the area \\nat half speed doesn’t need to make the saving throw.\\n Block and Tackle. A set of pulleys with a cable \\nthreaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a \\nblock and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the \\nweight you can normally lift.\\n Book. A book might contain poetry, historical ac -\\ncounts, information pertaining to a particular field of \\nlore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just \\nabout anything else that can be represented using text or \\npictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later \\nin this section).\\n Caltrops. As an action, you can spread a single bag \\nof caltrops to cover a 5-foot-square area. Any creature \\nthat enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity \\nsaving throw or stop moving and take 1 piercing dam -\\nage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hit point, its \\nwalking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A creature moving \\nthrough the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the \\nsaving throw.\\n Candle. For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a \\n5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.\\n Case, Crossbow Bolt. This wooden case can hold up to \\ntwenty crossbow bolts.\\n Case, Map or Scroll. This cylindrical leather case can \\nhold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up \\nsheets of parchment.\\n Chain. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a \\nsuccessful DC 20 Strength check.\\n Climber’s Kit. A climber’s kit includes special pitons, \\nboot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climb -\\ner’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you  Thrown.  If a weapon has the thrown property, you can \\nthrow the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon \\nis a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for \\nthat attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a \\nmelee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw \\na handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dag -\\nger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, \\nsince the dagger has the finesse property.\\n Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands when \\nyou attack with it.\\n Versatile.  This weapon can be used with one or two \\nhands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the \\nproperty—the damage when the weapon is used with two \\nhands to make a melee attack.\\nImprovised Weapons\\nSometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have \\nto attack with whatever is close at hand. An improvised \\nweapon includes any object you can wield in one or two \\nhands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a \\nwagon wheel, or a dead goblin.\\n In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an \\nactual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a \\ntable leg is akin to a club. At the DM’s option, a character \\nproficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it \\nwere that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.\\n An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals \\n1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropri -\\nate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon \\nto make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that \\ndoes not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 dam -\\nage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range \\nof 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.\\nSilvered Weapons\\nSome monsters that have immunity or resistance to \\nnonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, \\nso cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their \\nweapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or \\nten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents \\nnot only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise \\nneeded to add silver to the weapon without making it less \\neffective.\\nSpecial Weapons\\nWeapons with special rules are described here.\\n Lance.  You have disadvantage when you use a lance to \\nattack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires \\ntwo hands to wield when you aren’t mounted.\\n Net. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is re -\\nstrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures \\nthat are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. \\nA creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength \\ncheck, freeing itself or another creature within its reach \\non a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC \\n10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the \\neffect and destroying the net.\\n When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to at -\\ntack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless \\nof the number of attacks you can normally make.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 49}, page_content='5050 Chapter 5: Equipment\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

A bullseye lantern casts bright light \\nin a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. \\nOnce lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.\\n Lantern, Hooded. A hooded lantern casts bright light \\nin a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. \\nOnce lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As \\nan action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to \\ndim light in a 5-foot radius.\\n Lock. A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, \\na creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick this lock \\nwith a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your DM may \\ndecide that better locks are available for higher prices.\\n Magnifying Glass. This lens allows a closer look at \\nsmall objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and \\nsteel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magni -\\nfying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, \\ntinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. \\nA magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check \\nmade to appraise or inspect an item that is small or \\nhighly detailed.\\n Manacles. These metal restraints can bind a Small \\nor Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires \\na successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them \\nrequires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each \\nset of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, \\na creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the \\nmanacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity \\ncheck. Manacles have 15 hit points.can’t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you \\nanchored yourself, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet \\naway from that point without undoing the anchor.\\n Component Pouch.  A component pouch is a small, wa -\\ntertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold \\nall the material components and other special items you \\nneed to cast your spells, except for those components that \\nhave a specific cost (as indicated in a spell’s description).\\n Crowbar. Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength \\nchecks where the crowbar’s leverage can be applied.\\n Druidic Focus.  A druidic focus might be a sprig of mis -\\ntletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another \\nspecial wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a \\ntotem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth \\nfrom sacred animals. A druid (see chapter 3 of the Player’s \\nHandbook ) can use such an object as a spellcasting focus, \\nas described in chapter 10.\\n Fishing Tackle. This kit includes a wooden rod, silken \\nline, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet \\nlures, and narrow netting.\\n Healer’s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing \\nbandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As \\nan action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a \\ncreature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a \\nWisdom (Medicine) check.\\n Holy Symbol. A holy symbol is a representation of \\na god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a \\nsymbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully \\nengraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box \\nholding a fragment of a sacred relic. The Player’s Hand -\\nbook  lists many gods in the multiverse and their typical \\nsymbols. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a \\nspellcasting focus, as described in chapter 10. To use the \\nsymbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear \\nit visibly, or bear it on a shield.\\n Holy Water. As an action, you can splash the contents \\nof this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw \\nit up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, \\nmake a ranged attack against a target creature, treating \\nthe holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a \\nfiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.\\n A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing \\na special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses \\n25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to \\nexpend a 1st-level spell slot.\\n Hunting Trap. When you use your action to set it, this \\ntrap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when \\na creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The \\ntrap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, \\nsuch as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A crea -\\nture that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 \\nDexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and \\nstop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free \\nof the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the \\nchain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action \\nto make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another \\ncreature within its reach on a success. Each failed check \\ndeals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.\\n Lamp. A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and \\ndim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 \\nhours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.\\nEquipment Packs\\nThe starting equipment you get from your class includes \\na collection of useful adventuring gear, put together in a \\npack. The contents of these packs are listed here. If you are \\nbuying your starting equipment, you can purchase a pack \\nfor the price shown, which might be cheaper than buying \\nthe items individually.\\n Burglar’s Pack (16 gp).

Your race, class, background, or feats give \\nyou proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool \\nallows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability \\ncheck you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to \\na single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents \\nbroader knowledge of its use. For example, the DM might \\nask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail \\nwith your woodcarver’s tools, or a Strength check to \\nmake something out of particularly hard wood.\\n Artisan’s Tools. These special tools include the items \\nneeded to pursue a craft or trade. The table shows exam -\\nples of the most common types of tools, each providing \\nitems related to a single craft. Proficiency with a set \\nof artisan’s tools lets you add your proficiency bonus \\nto any ability checks you make using the tools in your \\ncraft. Each type of artisan’s tools requires a separate \\nproficiency.\\n Disguise Kit. This pouch of cosmetics, hair dye, and \\nsmall props lets you create disguises that change your \\nphysical appearance.

Mess Kit. This tin box contains a cup and simple cut -\\nlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used \\nas a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.\\n Oil. Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. \\nAs an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a \\ncreature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, \\nshattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a \\ntarget creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised \\nweapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target \\ntakes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 min -\\nute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the \\nburning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground \\nto cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface \\nis level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire \\ndamage to any creature that enters the area or ends its \\nturn in the area. A creature can take this damage only \\nonce per turn.\\n Poison, Basic. You can use the poison in this vial \\nto coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three \\npieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an \\naction. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammu -\\nnition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or \\ntake 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison re -\\ntains potency for 1 minute before drying.\\n Potion of Healing. A character who drinks the magical \\nred fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking \\nor administering a potion takes an action.\\n Pouch. A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling \\nbullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A \\ncompartmentalized pouch for holding spell components \\nis called a component pouch (described earlier in this \\nsection). \\n Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.\\n Ram, Portable. You can use a portable ram to break \\ndown doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the \\nStrength check. One other character can help you use the \\nram, giving you advantage on this check.\\n Rations. Rations consist of dry foods suitable for \\nextended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hard -\\ntack, and nuts.\\n Rope. Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit \\npoints and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.\\n Scale, Merchant’s. A scale includes a small bal -\\nance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to \\n2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight \\nof small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade \\ngoods, to help determine their worth.\\n Spellbook. Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a \\nleather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable \\nfor recording spells.\\n Spyglass. Objects viewed through a spyglass are mag -\\nnified to twice their size.\\n Tent. A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent \\nsleeps two.\\n Tinderbox. This small container holds flint, fire steel, \\nand tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to \\nkindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else \\nwith abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting \\nany other fire takes 1 minute.\\n Torch. A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light \\nin a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. \\nIf you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it \\ndeals 1 fire damage.\"),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 52}, page_content='5353 Chapter 5: Equipment\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

This set of instruments is used for \\nnavigation at sea. Proficiency with navigator’s tools lets \\nyou chart a ship’s course and follow navigation charts. \\nIn addition, these tools allow you to add your proficiency \\nbonus to any ability check you make to avoid getting \\nlost at sea.\\n Poisoner’s Kit. A poisoner’s kit includes the vials, \\nchemicals, and other equipment necessary for the cre -\\nation of poisons. Proficiency with this kit lets you add \\nyour proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to \\ncraft or use poisons.\\n Thieves’ Tools. This set of tools includes a small file, a \\nset of lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal han -\\ndle, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers. \\nProficiency with these tools lets you add your proficiency \\nbonus to any ability checks you make to disarm traps or \\nopen locks.\\nMounts and Vehicles\\nA good mount can help you move more quickly through \\nthe wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the \\ngear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts \\nand Other Animals table shows each animal’s speed and \\nbase carrying capacity.\\n An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or \\nwagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying \\ncapacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple \\nanimals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carry -\\ning capacity together.\\n Mounts other than those listed here are available in the \\nworlds of D&D, but they are rare and not normally avail -\\nable for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, \\ngriffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even \\naquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring \\nsuch a mount often means securing an egg and raising \\nthe creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful \\nentity, or negotiating with the mount itself.\\n Barding. Barding is armor designed to protect an \\nanimal’s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor \\nshown on the Armor table in this chapter can be pur -\\nchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent \\narmor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.\\n Saddles. A military saddle braces the rider, helping you \\nkeep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you \\nadvantage on any check you make to remain mounted. \\nAn exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or \\nflying mount.\\n Vehicle Proficiency. If you have proficiency with a \\ncertain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your \\nproficiency bonus to any check you make to control that \\nkind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.\\n Rowed Vessels. Keelboats and rowboats are used on \\nlakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of \\nthe current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the \\nvehicle. These vehicles can’t be rowed against any signif -\\nicant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft \\nanimals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in \\ncase adventurers carry it over land.Item Cost Weight\\nPainter’s supplies 10 gp 5 lb.\\nPotter’s tools 10 gp 3 lb.\\nSmith’s tools 20 gp 8 lb.\\nTinker’s tools 50 gp 10 lb.\\nWeaver’s tools 1 gp 5 lb.\\nWoodcarver’s tools 1 gp 5 lb.\\nDisguise kit 25 gp 3 lb.\\nForgery kit 15 gp 5 lb.\\nGaming set\\nDice set 1 sp —\\nDragonchess set 1 gp 1/2 lb.\\nPlaying card set 5 sp —\\nThree-Dragon Ante set 1 gp —\\nHerbalism kit 5 gp 3 lb.\\nMusical instrument\\nBagpipes 30 gp 6 lb.\\nDrum 6 gp 3 lb.\\nDulcimer 25 gp 10 lb.\\nFlute 2 gp 1 lb.\\nLute 35 gp 2 lb.\\nLyre 30 gp 2 lb.\\nHorn 3 gp 2 lb.\\nPan flute 12 gp 2 lb.\\nShawm 2 gp 1 lb.\\nViol 30 gp 1 lb.\\nNavigator’s tools 25 gp 2 lb.\\nPoisoner’s kit 50 gp 2 lb.\\nThieves’ tools 25 gp 1 lb.\\nVehicles (land or water) * *\\n* See the “Mounts and Vehicles” section.\\n Forgery Kit.

This item encompasses a wide range \\nof game pieces, including dice and decks of cards (for \\ngames such as Three-Dragon Ante). A few common \\nexamples appear on the Tools table, but other kinds of \\ngaming sets exist.

Even in a fantastical world, people require basic \\nnecessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. \\nThese things cost money, although some lifestyles cost \\nmore than others.\\nLifestyle Expenses\\nLifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to ac -\\ncount for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover \\nyour accommodations, food and drink, and all your other \\nnecessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of \\nmaintaining your equipment so you can be ready when \\nadventure next calls.\\n At the start of each week or month (your choice), \\nchoose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the \\nprice to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per \\nday, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen \\nlifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price \\nby 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the \\nnext, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you \\nmight maintain the same lifestyle throughout your char -\\nacter’s career.\\n Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Main -\\ntaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts \\nwith the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of at -\\ntracting thieves.

Most \\nsuch hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are \\nmasters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with spe -\\ncialized adventuring skills.\\n Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the \\nServices table. Other common hirelings include any of \\nthe wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or \\ncity, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific \\ntask. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to con -\\nstruct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for \\nuse in the Leomund’s secret  chest  spell. A fighter might \\ncommission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard \\nmight pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an up -\\ncoming performance in front of the duke.\\n Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous \\nservices. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventur -\\ners take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages \\nhired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level \\nadventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or \\nshe might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run \\nthe place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers \\nto keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a  Wretched.  You live in inhumane conditions. With no \\nplace to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneak -\\ning into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the \\ngood graces of people better off than you. A wretched \\nlifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, \\nand hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched \\npeople covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, \\nwhich represent a fortune by their standards. You are be -\\nneath the notice of most people.\\n Squalid. You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut \\njust outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house \\nin the worst part of town. You have shelter from the \\nelements, but you live in a desperate and often violent \\nenvironment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and \\nmisfortune. You are beneath the notice of most peo -\\nple, and you have few legal protections. Most people at \\nthis lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. \\nThey might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer \\nfrom disease.\\n Poor. A poor lifestyle means going without the com -\\nforts available in a stable community. Simple food and \\nlodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable condi -\\ntions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, \\nexperience. Your accommodations might be a room in \\na flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You \\nbenefit from some legal protections, but you still have \\nto contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at \\nthis lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, coste -\\nrmongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other \\ndisreputable types.\\n Modest. A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums \\nand ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You \\nlive in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding \\nhouse, inn, or temple. You don’t go hungry or thirsty, and \\nyour living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary peo -\\nple living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, \\nlaborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.\\n Comfortable. Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means \\nthat you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain \\nyour equipment. You live in a small cottage in a mid -\\ndle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. \\nYou associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and \\nmilitary officers.\\n Wealthy. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a \\nlife of luxury, though you might not have achieved the \\nsocial status associated with the old money of nobility or \\nroyalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly \\nsuccessful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or \\nthe owner of a few small businesses. You have respect -\\nable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of \\ntown or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a \\nsmall staff of servants.\\n Aristocratic. You live a life of plenty and comfort. You \\nmove in circles populated by the most powerful people \\nin the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps \\na townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the \\nfinest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the \\nmost skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants \\nattending to your every need. You receive invitations to \\nthe social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend \\nevenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, \\nhigh priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the \\nhighest levels of deceit and treachery.

The \\npay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require \\nmore pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work \\nthat requires no particular skill and can include laborers, \\nporters, maids, and similar workers.\\nSpellcasting Services\\nPeople who are able to cast spells don’t fall into the cat -\\negory of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find \\nsomeone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or \\nfavors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates \\nexist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, \\nthe harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the \\nmore it costs.\\n Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of \\n1st or 2nd level, such as cure wounds  or identify , is easy \\nenough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold \\npieces (plus the cost of any expensive material com -\\nponents). Finding someone able and willing to cast a \\nhigher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, \\nperhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once \\nfound, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of \\npayment—the kind of service that only adventurers can \\nprovide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous \\nlocale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to de -\\nliver something important to a distant settlement.\\nSelf-Sufficiency\\nThe expenses and lifestyles described in this chapter \\nassume that you are spending your time between \\nadventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services \\nyou can afford—paying for food and shelter, paying \\ntownspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, \\nand so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend \\ntheir time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in \\nthe wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.\\n Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to \\nspend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend \\nyour time between adventures practicing a profession, as \\ndescribed in chapter 8, you can eke out the equivalent of a \\npoor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at \\nthe equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.\"),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 56}, page_content=\"5757 Chapter 5: Equipment\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Chapter 6: Customization Options\\nThe combination of ability scores, race, class, and \\nbackground defines your character’s capabilities in the \\ngame, and the personal details you create set your char -\\nacter apart from every other character. Even within your \\nclass and race, you have options to fine-tune what your \\ncharacter can do. But a few players—with the DM’s per -\\nmission—want to go a step further.\\n Chapter 6 of the Player’s Handbook defines two \\noptional sets of rules for customizing your character: \\nmulticlassing and feats. Multiclassing lets you combine \\nclasses together, and feats are special options you can \\nchoose instead of increasing your ability scores as you \\ngain levels. Your DM decides whether these options are \\navailable in a campaign. \\nMulticlassing\\nMulticlassing allows you to gain levels in multiple \\nclasses. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those \\nclasses to realize a character concept that might not be \\nreflected in one of the standard class options.\\n With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level \\nin a new class whenever you advance in level, instead \\nof gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all \\nyour classes are added together to determine your char -\\nacter level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard \\nand two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level character.\\n As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain \\na member of your original class with just a few levels in \\nanother class, or you might change course entirely, never \\nlooking back at the class you left behind. You might even \\nstart progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to \\na single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice \\nsome focus in exchange for versatility.\\nPrerequisites\\nTo qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score \\nprerequisites for both your current class and your new \\none, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table \\nin the Player’s Handbook . Without the full training that \\na beginning character receives, you must be a quick \\nstudy in your new class, having a natural aptitude that \\nis reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.\\nExperience Points\\nThe experience point cost to gain a level is always based \\non your total character level, as shown in the Character \\nAdvancement table in chapter 1 of this document, not \\nyour level in a particular class.Hit Points and Hit Dice\\nYou gain the hit points from your new class as described \\nfor levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a \\nclass only when you are a 1st-level character.\\n You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your \\nclasses to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are \\nthe same die type, you can simply pool them together. \\nIf your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep \\ntrack of them separately.\\nProficiency Bonus\\nYour proficiency bonus is always based on your total \\ncharacter level, as shown in the Character Advancement \\ntable, not your level in a particular class.\\nProficiencies\\nWhen you gain a level in a class other than your first, you \\ngain only some of that class’s starting proficiencies. See \\nchapter 6 of the Player’s Handbook for more information.\\nClass Features\\nWhen you gain a new level in a class, you get its features \\nfor that level. A few features, however, have additional \\nrules when you’re multiclassing. See chapter 6 of the \\nPlayer’s Handbook for more information.\\nFeats\\nA feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives \\na character special capabilities. It embodies training, ex -\\nperience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. See \\nchapter 6 of the Player’s Handbook for more information.\\n At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score \\nImprovement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you \\ncan forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice \\ninstead. You can take each feat only once, unless the \\nfeat’s description says otherwise. \\n You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to \\ntake that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you \\ncan’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite.

Brilliant and \\ncharming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these \\nqualities—a creature’s assets as well as weaknesses.\\n The three main rolls of the game—the ability check, the \\nsaving throw, and the attack roll—rely on the six ability \\nscores. The book’s introduction describes the basic rule \\nbehind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier de -\\nrived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the \\ntotal to a target number.\\n This chapter focuses on how to use ability checks and \\nsaving throws, covering the fundamental activities that \\ncreatures attempt in the game. Rules for attack rolls ap -\\npear in chapter 9.\\nAbility Scores and \\nModifiers\\nEach of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that \\ndefines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is \\nnot just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encom -\\npasses a creature’s training and competence in activities \\nrelated to that ability.\\n A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but \\nadventurers and many monsters are a cut above average \\nin most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a per -\\nson usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high \\nas 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as \\nhigh as 30.\\n Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score \\nand ranging from −5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for \\na score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table \\nnotes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability \\nscores, from 1 to 30.\\n To determine an ability modifier without consulting the \\ntable, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide \\nthe total by 2 (round down). Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack \\nroll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers \\ncome up in play more often than their associated scores.\\nAdvantage and \\nDisadvantage\\nSometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you \\nhave advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a \\nsaving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you \\nroll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher \\nof the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower \\nroll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have \\ndisadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you \\ninstead have advantage and roll those numbers, you \\nuse the 17.\\n If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants \\nadvantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll \\nmore than one additional d20. If two favorable situations \\ngrant advantage, for example, you still roll only one addi -\\ntional d20.\\n If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage \\nand disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of \\nthem, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple \\ncircumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants \\nadvantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have nei -\\nther advantage nor disadvantage.\\n When you have advantage or disadvantage and some -\\nthing in the game, such as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets \\nyou reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace \\nonly one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, \\nif a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability \\ncheck and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the \\nLucky trait to reroll the 1.\\n You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through \\nthe use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration \\ncan also give a character advantage (as explained in \\nchapter 4, “Personality and Background”). The DM can \\nalso decide that circumstances influence a roll in one \\ndirection or the other and grant advantage or impose dis -\\nadvantage as a result.\\nProficiency Bonus\\nCharacters have a proficiency bonus determined by level, \\nas detailed in chapter 1. Monsters also have this bonus, \\nwhich is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is \\nused in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and \\nattack rolls.\\n Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die \\nroll or other number more than once. For example, if two \\ndifferent rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to \\na Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus \\nonly once when you make the save.\\n Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multi -\\nplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before \\nyou apply it. For example, the rogue’s Expertise feature \\ndoubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. \\nIf a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus Ability Scores and Modifiers\\nScore Modifier\\n1 −5\\n2–3 −4\\n4–5 −3\\n6–7 −2\\n8–9 −1\\n10 –11 +0\\n12–13 +1\\n14–15 +2Score Modifier\\n16 –17 +3\\n18–19 +4\\n20–21 +5\\n22–23 +6\\n24–25 +7\\n26–27 +8\\n28–29 +9\\n30 +10Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores '),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 60}, page_content='6161 Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores \\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

For instance, if \\nyou lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no ben -\\nefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency \\nbonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.\\n In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for \\nattack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows \\nyou to do so, these same rules apply.\\nAbility Checks\\nAn ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate \\ntalent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. \\nThe DM calls for an ability check when a character or \\nmonster attempts an action (other than an attack) that \\nhas a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, \\nthe dice determine the results.\\n For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six \\nabilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty \\nof the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more \\ndifficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty \\nClasses table shows the most common DCs.\\nTypical Difficulty Classes\\nTask Difficulty DC\\nVery easy 5\\nEasy 10\\nMedium 15\\nHard 20\\nVery hard 25\\nNearly impossible 30\\n To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the rel -\\nevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply \\nbonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. \\nIf the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check \\nis a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at \\nhand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the charac -\\nter or monster makes no progress toward the objective \\nor makes progress combined with a setback determined \\nby the DM.\\nContests\\nSometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are di -\\nrectly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both \\nof them are trying to do the same thing and only one can \\nsucceed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring \\nthat has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies \\nwhen one of them is trying to prevent the other one from \\naccomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries \\nto force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. \\nIn situations like these, the outcome is determined by a \\nspecial form of ability check, called a contest.\\n Both participants in a contest make ability checks \\nappropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate \\nbonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The \\nparticipant with the higher check total wins the contest. \\nThat character or monster either succeeds at the action \\nor prevents the other one from succeeding.\\n If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the \\nsame as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant \\nmight win the contest by default. If two characters tie in \\na contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character \\ngrabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open \\na door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, \\na tie means that the door remains shut.\\nSkills\\nEach ability covers a broad range of capabilities, includ -\\ning skills that a character or a monster can be proficient \\nin. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, \\nand an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates \\na focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill pro -\\nficiencies are determined at character creation, and a \\nmonster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s \\nstat block.)\\n For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a char -\\nacter’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an \\nobject, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexter -\\nity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, \\nand Stealth, respectively. So a character who has profi -\\nciency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity \\nchecks related to sneaking and hiding.\\n The skills related to each ability score are shown in \\nthe following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) \\nSee an ability’s description in the later sections of this \\nchapter for examples of how to use a skill associated \\nwith an ability.\\nStrength\\nAthletics\\nDexterity\\nAcrobatics\\nSleight of Hand\\nStealth\\nIntelligence\\nArcana\\nHistory\\nInvestigation\\nNature\\nReligionWisdom\\nAnimal Handling\\nInsight\\nMedicine\\nPerception\\nSurvival\\nCharisma\\nDeception\\nIntimidation\\nPerformance\\nPersuasion\\n Sometimes, the DM might ask for an ability check \\nusing a specific skill—for example, “Make a Wisdom (Per -\\nception) check.” At other times, a player might ask the \\nDM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. \\nIn either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual \\ncan add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that \\ninvolve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the indi -\\nvidual makes a normal ability check.\\n For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dan -\\ngerous cliff, the Dungeon Master might ask for a Strength \\n(Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Ath -\\nletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the \\nStrength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he \\nor she just makes a Strength check.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 61}, page_content='6262 Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores \\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Variant: Skills with Different Abilities\\nNormally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a \\nspecific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, \\nfor example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some \\nsituations, though, your proficiency might reasonably \\napply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM \\nmight ask for a check using an unusual combination of \\nability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can ap -\\nply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you \\nhave to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, \\nyour DM might call for a Constitution check to see if you \\nhave the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your \\nDM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics \\nand ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you’re \\nproficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to \\nthe Constitution check just as you would normally do for \\na Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your dwarf \\nfighter uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an \\nenemy, your DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) \\ncheck, even though Intimidation is normally associated \\nwith Charisma.\\nPassive Checks\\nA passive check is a special kind of ability check that \\ndoesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent \\nthe average result for a task done repeatedly, such as \\nsearching for secret doors over and over again, or can be \\nused when the DM wants to secretly determine whether \\nthe characters succeed at something without rolling dice, \\nsuch as noticing a hidden monster.\\n Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a pas -\\nsive check:\\n10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check\\nIf the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For \\ndisadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive \\ncheck total as a score .\\n For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of \\n15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive \\nWisdom (Perception) score of 14.\\n The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below \\nrely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules in \\nchapter 8.\\nWorking Together\\nSometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a \\ntask. The character who’s leading the effort—or the one \\nwith the highest ability modifier—can make an ability \\ncheck with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the \\nother characters. In combat, this requires the Help action \\n(see chapter 9).\\n A character can only provide help if the task is one that \\nhe or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open \\na lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a charac -\\nter who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character \\nin that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two \\nor more individuals working together would actually be \\nproductive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no \\neasier with help.Group Checks\\nWhen a number of individuals are trying to accomplish \\nsomething as a group, the DM might ask for a group \\nability check. In such a situation, the characters who are \\nskilled at a particular task help cover those who aren’t.\\n To make a group ability check, everyone in the group \\nmakes the ability check. If at least half the group \\nsucceeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the \\ngroup fails.\\n Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re \\nmost useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a \\ngroup. For example, when adventurers are navigating a \\nswamp, the DM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) \\ncheck to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, \\nsinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. \\nIf at least half the group succeeds, the successful char -\\nacters are able to guide their companions out of danger. \\nOtherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.\\nUsing Each Ability\\nEvery task that a character or monster might attempt \\nin the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This \\nsection explains in more detail what those abilities mean \\nand the ways they are used in the game.\\nStrength\\nStrength measures bodily power, athletic training, and \\nthe extent to which you can exert raw physical force.\\nStrength Checks\\nA Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, \\npull, or break something, to force your body through a \\nspace, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. \\nThe Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of \\nStrength checks.\\n Athletics. Your Strength (Athletics) check covers \\ndifficult situations you encounter while climbing, \\njumping, or swimming. Examples include the \\nfollowing activities:\\n• You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid \\nhazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while \\nsomething is trying to knock you off.\\n• You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull \\noff a stunt midjump.\\n• You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous cur -\\nrents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. \\nOr another creature tries to push or pull you underwa -\\nter or otherwise interfere with your swimming.\\n Other Strength Checks. The DM might also call for \\na Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like \\nthe following:\\n• Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door\\n• Break free of bonds\\n• Push through a tunnel that is too small\\n• Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it\\n• Tip over a statue\\n• Keep a boulder from rolling'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 62}, page_content='6363 Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores \\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Attack Rolls and Damage\\nYou add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and \\nyour damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon \\nsuch as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use me -\\nlee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand \\ncombat, and some of them can be thrown to make a \\nranged attack.\\nLifting and Carrying\\nYour Strength score determines the amount of weight \\nyou can bear. The following terms define what you can \\nlift or carry.\\n Carrying Capacity. Your carrying capacity is your \\nStrength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in \\npounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that \\nmost characters don’t usually have to worry about it.\\n Push, Drag, or Lift. You can push, drag, or lift a weight \\nin pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times \\nyour Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight \\nin excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops \\nto 5 feet.\\n Size and Strength.  Larger creatures can bear more \\nweight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each \\nsize category above Medium, double the creature’s carry -\\ning capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For \\na Tiny creature, halve these weights.\\nVariant: Encumbrance\\nThe rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally sim -\\nple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed \\nrules for determining how a character is hindered by the \\nweight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore \\nthe Strength column of the Armor table in chapter 5. \\n If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength \\nscore, you are encumbered , which means your speed \\ndrops by 10 feet.\\n If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength \\nscore, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are \\ninstead heavily encumbered , which means your speed \\ndrops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability \\nchecks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, \\nDexterity, or Constitution.\\nDexterity\\nDexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.\\nDexterity Checks\\nA Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, \\nquickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky foot -\\ning. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills \\nreflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.\\n Acrobatics. Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers \\nyour attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such \\nas when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance \\non a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. \\nThe DM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check \\nto see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including \\ndives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.\\n Sleight of Hand. Whenever you attempt an act of leger -\\ndemain or manual trickery, such as planting something \\non someone else or concealing an object on your per -\\nson, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The DM \\nmight also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another \\nperson or slip something out of another \\nperson’s pocket.\\n Stealth. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you \\nattempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past \\nguards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on \\nsomeone without being seen or heard.\\n Other Dexterity Checks. The DM might call for a \\nDexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like \\nthe following:\\n• Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent\\n• Steer a chariot around a tight turn\\n• Pick a lock\\n• Disable a trap\\n• Securely tie up a prisoner\\n• Wriggle free of bonds\\n• Play a stringed instrument\\n• Craft a small or detailed object\\nAttack Rolls and Damage\\nYou add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and \\nyour damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, \\nsuch as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dex -\\nterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll \\nwhen attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse \\nproperty, such as a dagger or a rapier.\\nHiding\\nThe DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for \\nhiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) \\ncheck. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that \\ncheck’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) \\ncheck of any creature that actively searches for signs of \\nyour presence.\\n You can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, \\nand you give away your position if you make noise, such as \\nshouting a warning or knocking over a vase. An invisible \\ncreature can’t be seen, so it can always try to hide. Signs of \\nits passage might still be noticed, however, and it still has \\nto stay quiet.\\n In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger \\nall around, so if you come out of hiding and approach \\na creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain \\ncircumstances, the Dungeon Master might allow you to \\nstay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, \\nallowing you to gain advantage on an attack before \\nyou are seen.\\n Passive Perception. When you hide, there’s a chance \\nsomeone will notice you even if they aren’t searching. To \\ndetermine whether such a creature notices you, the DM \\ncompares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s \\npassive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the \\ncreature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses \\nor penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For \\ndisadvantage, subtract 5.\\n For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency \\nbonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and \\nproficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom \\n(Perception) of 14.\\n What Can You See? One of the main factors in \\ndetermining whether you can find a hidden creature or \\nobject is how well you can see in an area, which might be \\nlightly or heavily obscured, as explained in chapter 8.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 63}, page_content='6464 Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores \\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Initiative determines the order \\nof creatures’ turns in combat, as described in chapter 9.\\nConstitution\\nConstitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.\\nConstitution Checks\\nConstitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply \\nto Constitution checks, because the endurance this abil -\\nity represents is largely passive rather than involving a \\nspecific effort on the part of a character or monster. A \\nConstitution check can model your attempt to push be -\\nyond normal limits, however.\\n The DM might call for a Constitution check when you \\ntry to accomplish tasks like the following:\\n• Hold your breath\\n• March or labor for hours without rest\\n• Go without sleep\\n• Survive without food or water\\n• Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go\\nHit Points\\nYour Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. \\nTypically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit \\nDie you roll for your hit points.\\n If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point \\nmaximum changes as well, as though you had the new \\nmodifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your \\nConstitution score when you reach 4th level and your \\nConstitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you ad -\\njust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had \\nalways been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first \\nthree levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level \\nusing your new modifier. Or if you’re 7th level and some \\neffect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your \\nConstitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is \\nreduced by 7.\\nIntelligence\\nIntelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, \\nand the ability to reason.\\nIntelligence Checks\\nAn Intelligence check comes into play when you need \\nto draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive rea -\\nsoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and \\nReligion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelli -\\ngence checks.\\n Arcana. Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures \\nyour ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, \\neldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of exis -\\ntence, and the inhabitants of those planes.\\n History. Your Intelligence (History) check mea -\\nsures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, re -\\ncent wars, and lost civilizations.\\n Investigation. When you look around for clues and \\nmake deductions based on those clues, you make an \\nIntelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the \\nlocation of a hidden object, discern from the appearance \\nof a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the \\nweakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. \\nPoring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden \\nfragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence \\n(Investigation) check.\\n Nature. Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures \\nyour ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and ani -\\nmals, the weather, and natural cycles.\\n Religion. Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures \\nyour ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, \\nreligious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices  \\nof secret cults.\\n Other Intelligence Checks. The DM might call for an \\nIntelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like \\nthe following:\\n• Communicate with a creature without using words\\n• Estimate the value of a precious item\\n• Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard\\n• Forge a document\\n• Recall lore about a craft or trade\\n• Win a game of skill\\nSpellcasting Ability\\nWizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, \\nwhich helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells \\nthey cast.\\nWisdom\\nWisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around \\nyou and represents perceptiveness and intuition. \\nWisdom Checks\\nA Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body \\nlanguage, understand someone’s feelings, notice things \\nabout the environment, or care for an injured person. \\nThe Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and \\nSurvival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wis -\\ndom checks.\\n Animal Handling. When there is any question whether \\nyou can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount \\nFinding a Hidden Object\\nWhen your character searches for a hidden object such as \\na secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make \\na Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to \\nfind hidden details or other information and clues that you \\nmight otherwise overlook.\\n In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking \\nin order for the DM to determine your chance of success. \\nFor example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes \\nin the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you \\npace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for \\nclues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of \\nyour Wisdom (Perception) check result.

Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether \\nyou can determine the true intentions of a creature, such \\nas when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next \\nmove. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body lan -\\nguage, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\\n Medicine. A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to \\nstabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.\\n Perception. Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you \\nspot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. \\nIt measures your general awareness of  \\nyour surroundings and the keenness of your senses.  \\nFor example, you might try to hear a conversation through \\na closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear \\nmonsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try \\nto spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether \\nthey are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in \\nthe shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed \\nsecret door.\\n Survival. The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom \\n(Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide \\nyour group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that \\nowlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quick -\\nsand and other natural hazards.\\n Other Wisdom Checks. The DM might call for a \\nWisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like \\nthe following:\\n• Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow\\n• Discern whether a seemingly dead or living crea -\\nture is undead\\nSpellcasting Ability\\nClerics use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which \\nhelps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\\nCharisma\\nCharisma measures your ability to interact effectively \\nwith others. It includes such factors as confidence and \\neloquence, and it can represent a charming or command -\\ning personality.\\nCharisma Checks\\nA Charisma check might arise when you try to influence \\nor entertain others, when you try to make an impres -\\nsion or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating \\na tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, \\nPerformance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in \\ncertain kinds of Charisma checks.\\n Deception. Your Charisma (Deception) check deter -\\nmines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either \\nverbally or through your actions. This deception can \\nencompass everything from misleading others through \\nambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations in -\\nclude trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn \\nmoney through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, \\ndull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or main -\\ntain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.\\n Intimidation. When you attempt to influence some -\\none through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma \\n(Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry in -\\nformation out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs \\nto back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of \\na broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to recon -\\nsider a decision.\\n Performance. Your Charisma (Performance) check \\ndetermines how well you can delight an audience with \\nmusic, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of \\nentertainment.\\n Persuasion. When you attempt to influence someone \\nor a group of people with tact, social graces, or good \\nnature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma \\n(Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when \\nacting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial \\nrequests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of per -\\nsuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let \\nyour party see the king, negotiating peace between war -\\nring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.\\n Other Charisma Checks. The DM might call for a \\nCharisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like \\nthe following:\\n• Find the best person to talk to for news, \\nrumors, and gossip\\n• Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics \\nof conversation\\nSpellcasting Ability\\nBards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma \\nas their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the \\nsaving throw DCs of spells they cast.\\nSaving Throws\\nA saving throw—also called a save—represents an at -\\ntempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or \\na similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a \\nsaving throw; you are forced to make one because your \\ncharacter or monster is at risk of harm.\\n To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the ap -\\npropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your \\nDexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.\\n A saving throw can be modified by a situational \\nbonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage \\nand disadvantage, as determined by the DM.\\n Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving \\nthrows. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelli -\\ngence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a \\nsaving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bo -\\nnus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. \\nSome monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.\\n The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by \\nthe effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving \\nthrow allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s \\nspellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.\\n The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also \\ndetailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a suc -\\ncessful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or \\nreduced harm, from an effect.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 65}, page_content='6666 Chapter 8: Adventuring\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Movement\\nSwimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dun -\\ngeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope—all \\nsorts of movement play a key role in D&D adventures.\\n The DM can summarize the adventurers’ movement \\nwithout calculating exact distances or travel times: “You \\ntravel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance \\nlate in the evening of the third day.” Even in a dungeon, \\nparticularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the DM \\ncan summarize movement between encounters: “After \\nkilling the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwar -\\nven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you \\nthrough miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by \\na narrow stone arch.”\\n Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it \\ntakes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer \\nis in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining \\ntravel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel \\npace of the creatures moving and the terrain they’re \\nmoving over.\\nSpeed\\nEvery character and monster has a speed, which is the \\ndistance in feet that the character or monster can walk in \\n1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic \\nmovement in the midst of a life-threatening situation. \\n The following rules determine how far a character \\nor monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.\\nTravel Pace\\nWhile traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a \\nnormal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace \\ntable. The table states how far the party can move in a \\nperiod of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast \\npace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace \\nmakes it possible to sneak around and to search an area \\nmore carefully (see the “Activity While Traveling” section \\nlater in this chapter for more information).\\n Forced March. The Travel Pace table assumes that \\ncharacters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on be -\\nyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.\\n For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, \\nthe characters cover the distance shown in the Hour \\ncolumn for their pace, and each character must make a \\nConstitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC \\nis 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving \\nthrow, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see \\nappendix A).\\n Mounts and Vehicles. For short spans of time (up to an \\nhour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. \\nA mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an \\nhour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If \\nfresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters \\ncan cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very \\nrare except in densely populated areas.\\n Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles \\nchoose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne \\nvessel are limited to the speed of the vessel (see chapter Delving into the ancient Tomb of Horrors, slipping \\nthrough the back alleys of Waterdeep, hacking a fresh \\ntrail through the thick jungles on the Isle of Dread—these \\nare the things that Dungeons & Dragons adventures \\nare made of. Your character in the game might explore \\nforgotten ruins and uncharted lands, uncover dark se -\\ncrets and sinister plots, and slay foul monsters. And if \\nall goes well, your character will survive to claim rich \\nrewards before embarking on a new adventure.\\n This chapter covers the basics of the adventuring life, \\nfrom the mechanics of movement to the complexities of \\nsocial interaction. The rules for resting are also in this \\nchapter, along with a discussion of the activities your \\ncharacter might pursue between adventures.\\n Whether adventurers are exploring a dusty dungeon \\nor the complex relationships of a royal court, the game \\nfollows a natural rhythm, as outlined in the book’s \\nintroduction:\\n1.  The DM describes the environment.\\n2.  The players describe what they want to do.\\n3.  The DM narrates the results of their actions.\\nTypically, the DM uses a map as an outline of the adven -\\nture, tracking the characters’ progress as they explore \\ndungeon corridors or wilderness regions. The DM’s \\nnotes, including a key to the map, describe what the ad -\\nventurers find as they enter each new area. Sometimes, \\nthe passage of time and the adventurers’ actions deter -\\nmine what happens, so the DM might use a timeline or a \\nflowchart to track their progress instead of a map.\\nTime\\nIn situations where keeping track of the passage of time \\nis important, the DM determines the time a task requires. \\nThe DM might use a different time scale depending on \\nthe context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon envi -\\nronment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a scale \\nof minutes . It takes them about a minute to creep down \\na long hallway, another minute to check for traps on \\nthe door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes \\nto search the chamber beyond for anything interesting \\nor valuable.\\n In a city or wilderness, a scale of hours  is often more \\nappropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower \\nat the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles \\nin just under four hours’ time.\\n For long journeys, a scale of days  works best. Fol -\\nlowing the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the \\nadventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin \\nambush interrupts their journey.\\n In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game \\nrelies on rounds , a 6-second span of time described in \\nchapter 9.Chapter 8: Adventuring'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 66}, page_content='6767 Chapter 8: Adventuring\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Depending on the vessel and \\nthe size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to \\n24 hours per day.\\n Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, \\nor special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying , allow you \\nto travel more swiftly. The Dungeon Master’s Guide con -\\ntains more information on special methods of travel.\\nTravel Pace\\nPace Distance Traveled per . . .\\nMinute Hour Day Effect\\nFast 400 feet 4 miles 30 miles −5 penalty to \\npassive Wisdom \\n(Perception) scores\\nNormal 300 feet 3 miles 24 miles —\\nSlow 200 feet 2 miles 18 miles Able to use stealth\\nDifficult Terrain\\nThe travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume \\nrelatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dun -\\ngeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, \\ndeep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and \\nice-covered ground—all considered difficult terrain.\\n You move at half speed in difficult terrain—moving \\n1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you \\ncan cover only half the normal distance in a minute, \\nan hour, or a day.\\nSpecial Types of Movement\\nMovement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness \\nareas often involves more than simply walking. Adven -\\nturers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get \\nwhere they need to go.\\nClimbing, Swimming, and Crawling\\nEach foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet \\nin difficult terrain) when you’re climbing, swimming, or \\ncrawling. You ignore this extra cost if you have a climbing \\nspeed and use it to climb or a swimming speed and use it \\nto swim. At the DM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical \\nsurface or one with few handholds requires a successful \\nStrength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any dis -\\ntance in rough water might require a successful Strength \\n(Athletics) check.\\nJumping\\nYour Strength determines how far you can jump.\\n Long Jump. When you make a long jump, you cover a  \\nnumber of feet up to your Strength score if you move at \\nleast 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When \\nyou make a standing long jump, you can leap only half \\nthat distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump \\ncosts a foot of movement.\\n This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t \\nmatter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At \\nyour DM’s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength \\n(Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a \\nquarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low \\nwall. Otherwise, you hit it. When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on \\na DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. \\nOtherwise, you land prone.\\n High Jump. When you make a high jump, you leap \\ninto the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength \\nmodifier (minimum of 0 feet) if you move at least 10 feet \\non foot immediately before the jump. When you make a \\nstanding high jump, you can jump only half that distance. \\nEither way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of \\nmovement. In some circumstances, your DM might allow \\nyou to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher \\nthan you normally can.\\n You can extend your arms half your height above your -\\nself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a \\ndistance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times \\nyour height.\\nActivity While Traveling\\nAs adventurers travel through a dungeon or the wil -\\nderness, they need to remain alert for danger, and \\nsome characters might perform other tasks to help \\nthe group’s journey.\\nMarching Order\\nThe adventurers should establish a marching order. A \\nmarching order makes it easier to determine which char -\\nacters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden \\nenemies, and which ones are the closest to those ene -\\nmies when a fight breaks out.\\n A character might occupy the front rank, one or more \\nmiddle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front \\nand back ranks need enough room to travel side by side \\nwith others in their rank. When space is too tight, the \\nmarching order must change, usually by moving charac -\\nters to a middle rank.\\n Fewer Than Three Ranks. If an adventuring party \\narranges its marching order with only two ranks, they \\nare a front rank and a back rank. If there’s only one rank, \\nit’s considered a front rank.\\nStealth\\nWhile traveling at a slow pace, the characters can move \\nstealthily. As long as they’re not in the open, they can try \\nto surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter. \\nSee the rules for hiding in chapter 7.\\nSplitting Up the Party\\nSometimes, it makes sense to split an adventuring party, \\nespecially if you want one or more characters to scout \\nahead. You can form multiple parties, each moving at a \\ndifferent speed. Each group has its own front, middle, \\nand back ranks.\\n The drawback to this approach is that the party will be \\nsplit into several smaller groups in the event of an attack. \\nThe advantage is that a small group of stealthy characters \\nmoving slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that \\nclumsier characters would alert. A pair of rogues moving at \\na slow pace are much harder to detect when they leave their \\ndwarf fighter friend behind.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 67}, page_content='6868 Chapter 8: Adventuring\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Noticing Threats\\nUse the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the char -\\nacters to determine whether anyone in the group notices \\na hidden threat. The DM might decide that a threat can \\nbe noticed only by characters in a particular rank. For ex -\\nample, as the characters are exploring a maze of tunnels, \\nthe DM might decide that only those characters in the \\nback rank have a chance to hear or spot a stealthy crea -\\nture following the group, while characters in the front \\nand middle ranks cannot. \\n While traveling at a fast pace, characters take a –5 \\npenalty to their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores \\nto notice hidden threats.\\n Encountering Creatures. If the DM determines that \\nthe adventurers encounter other creatures while they’re \\ntraveling, it’s up to both groups to decide what happens \\nnext. Either group might decide to attack, initiate a \\nconversation, run away, or wait to see what the other \\ngroup does.\\n Surprising Foes. If the adventurers encounter a hostile \\ncreature or group, the DM determines whether the ad -\\nventurers or their foes might be surprised when combat \\nerupts. See chapter 9 for more about surprise.\\nOther Activities\\nCharacters who turn their attention to other tasks as the \\ngroup travels are not focused on watching for danger. \\nThese characters don’t contribute their passive Wisdom \\n(Perception) scores to the group’s chance of noticing \\nhidden threats. However, a character not watching for \\ndanger can do one of the following activities instead, or \\nsome other activity with the DM’s permission.\\n Navigate. The character can try to prevent the group \\nfrom becoming lost, making a Wisdom (Survival) check \\nwhen the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide \\nhas rules to determine whether the group gets lost.)\\n Draw a Map. The character can draw a map that \\nrecords the group’s progress and helps the characters \\nget back on course if they get lost. No ability check \\nis required.\\n Track. A character can follow the tracks of another \\ncreature, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the \\nDM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide has rules \\nfor tracking.)\\n Forage. The character can keep an eye out for ready \\nsources of food and water, making a Wisdom (Survival) \\ncheck when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s \\nGuide  has rules for foraging.)\\nThe Environment\\nBy its nature, adventuring involves delving into places \\nthat are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be ex -\\nplored. The rules in this section cover some of the most \\nimportant ways in which adventurers interact with the en -\\nvironment in such places. The Dungeon Master’s Guide \\nhas rules covering more unusual situations.\\nFalling\\nA fall from a great height is one of the most common haz -\\nards facing an adventurer.\\n At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning \\ndamage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage \\nfrom the fall.\\nSuffocating\\nA creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes \\nequal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of \\n30 seconds).\\n When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can \\nsurvive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution \\nmodifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next \\nturn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t re -\\ngain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.\\n For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can \\nhold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has \\n2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.\\nVision and Light\\nThe most fundamental tasks of adventuring—noticing \\ndanger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in com -\\nbat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few—rely heavily \\non a character’s ability to see. Darkness and other effects \\nthat obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.\\n A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a \\nlightly obscured  area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or \\nmoderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wis -\\ndom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\\n A heavily obscured  area—such as darkness, opaque \\nfog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature ef -\\nfectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix \\nA) when trying to see something in that area.\\n The presence or absence of light in an environment \\ncreates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim \\nlight, and darkness.\\n Bright light  lets most creatures see normally. Even \\ngloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, \\nfires, and other sources of illumination within a spe -\\ncific radius.\\n Dim light , also called shadows, creates a lightly ob -\\nscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary \\nbetween a source of bright light, such as a torch, and sur -\\nrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn \\nalso counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon \\nmight bathe the land in dim light.\\n Darkness  creates a heavily obscured area. Charac -\\nters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit \\nnights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a sub -\\nterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.\\nBlindsight\\nA creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings \\nwithout relying on sight, within a specific radius. Crea -\\ntures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with \\necholocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true \\ndragons, have this sense.\\nDarkvision\\nMany creatures in the worlds of D&D, especially those \\nthat dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a speci -\\nfied range, a creature with darkvision can see in dim light \\nas if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim \\nlight, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far \\nas that creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t \\ndiscern color in darkness, only shades of gray.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 68}, page_content='6969 Chapter 8: Adventuring\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Truesight\\nA creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, \\nsee in normal and magical darkness, see invisible \\ncreatures and objects, automatically detect visual il -\\nlusions and succeed on saving throws against them, \\nand perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a \\ncreature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, \\nthe creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.\\nFood and Water\\nCharacters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of \\nexhaustion (see appendix A). Exhaustion caused by lack \\nof food or water can’t be removed until the character eats \\nand drinks the full required amount.\\nFood\\nA character needs one pound of food per day and can \\nmake food last longer by subsisting on half rations. \\nEating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day \\nwithout food.\\n A character can go without food for a number of days \\nequal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum \\n1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character \\nautomatically suffers one level of exhaustion.\\n  A normal day of eating resets the count of days without \\nfood to zero.\\nWater\\nA character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gal -\\nlons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks \\nonly half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Con -\\nstitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at \\nthe end of the day. A character with access to even less \\nwater automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the \\nend of the day.\\n If the character already has one or more levels of ex -\\nhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.\\nInteracting with Objects\\nA character’s interaction with objects in an environment \\nis often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the \\nDM that his or her character is doing something, such \\nas moving a lever, and the DM describes what, if any -\\nthing, happens.\\n For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, \\nwhich might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to \\nflood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If \\nthe lever is rusted in position, though, a character might \\nneed to force it. In such a situation, the DM might call \\nfor a Strength check to see whether the character can \\nwrench the lever into place. The DM sets the DC for any \\nsuch check based on the difficulty of the task.\\n Characters can also damage objects with their weap -\\nons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and \\npsychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by \\nphysical and magical attacks much like creatures can. \\nThe DM determines an object’s Armor Class and hit \\npoints, and might decide that certain objects have resis -\\ntance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s hard \\nto cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always \\nfail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an ob -\\nject drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.\\n A character can also attempt a Strength check to break \\nan object. The DM sets the DC for any such check.\\nSocial Interaction\\nExploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slay -\\ning monsters are key parts of D&D adventures. No less \\nimportant, though, are the social interactions that adven -\\nturers have with other inhabitants of the world.\\n Interaction takes on many forms. You might need to \\nconvince an unscrupulous thief to confess to some mal -\\nfeasance, or you might try to flatter a dragon so that it \\nwill spare your life. The DM assumes the roles of any \\ncharacters who are participating in the interaction that \\ndon’t belong to another player at the table. Any such char -\\nacter is called a nonplayer character  (NPC).\\n In general terms, an NPC’s attitude toward you is de -\\nscribed as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs \\nare predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are inclined \\nto get in your way. It’s easier to get what you want from a \\nfriendly NPC, of course.\\n Social interactions have two primary aspects: roleplay -\\ning and ability checks.\\nRoleplaying\\nRoleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In \\nthis case, it’s you  as a player determining how your char -\\nacter thinks, acts, and talks.\\n Roleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it \\ncomes to the fore during social interactions. Your charac -\\nter’s quirks, mannerisms, and personality influence how \\ninteractions resolve.\\n There are two styles you can use when roleplaying your \\ncharacter: the descriptive approach and the active ap -\\nproach. Most players use a combination of the two styles. \\nUse whichever mix of the two works best for you.\\nDescriptive Approach to Roleplaying\\nWith this approach, you describe your character’s words \\nand actions to the DM and the other players. Drawing on \\nyour mental image of your character, you tell everyone \\nwhat your character does and how he or she does it.\\n For instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf. Tordek has \\na quick temper and blames the elves of the Cloakwood \\nfor his family’s misfortune. At a tavern, an obnoxious elf \\nminstrel sits at Tordek’s table and tries to strike up a con -\\nversation with the dwarf.\\n Chris says, “Tordek spits on the floor, growls an insult \\nat the bard, and stomps over to the bar. He sits on a stool \\nand glares at the minstrel before ordering another drink.”\\n In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek’s mood \\nand given the DM a clear idea of his character’s attitude \\nand actions.\\n When using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following \\nthings in mind:\\n• Describe your character’s emotions and attitude.\\n• Focus on your character’s intent and how others \\nmight perceive it.\\n• Provide as much embellishment as you feel \\ncomfortable with.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 69}, page_content='7070 Chapter 8: Adventuring\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only. Don’t worry about getting things exactly right. Just fo -\\ncus on thinking about what your character would do and \\ndescribing what you see in your mind.\\nActive Approach to Roleplaying\\nIf descriptive roleplaying tells your DM and your fellow \\nplayers what your character thinks and does, active role -\\nplaying shows  them.\\n When you use active roleplaying, you speak with your \\ncharacter’s voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might \\neven echo your character’s movements and body language. \\nThis approach is more immersive than descriptive role -\\nplaying, though you still need to describe things that \\ncan’t be reasonably acted out.\\n Going back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek \\nabove, here’s how the scene might play out if Chris used \\nactive roleplaying:\\n Speaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice, \\n“I was wondering why it suddenly smelled awful in here. \\nIf I wanted to hear anything out of you, I’d snap your arm \\nand enjoy your screams.” In his normal voice, Chris then \\nadds, “I get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar.”\\nResults of Roleplaying\\nThe DM uses your character’s actions and attitudes to \\ndetermine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles \\nunder threats of violence. A stubborn dwarf refuses to let \\nanyone badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery.\\n When interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to \\nthe DM’s portrayal of the NPC’s mood, dialogue, and \\npersonality. You might be able to determine an NPC’s \\npersonality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on \\nthem to influence the NPC’s attitude.\\n Interactions in D&D are much like interactions in real \\nlife. If you can offer NPCs something they want, threaten \\nthem with something they fear, or play on their sympa -\\nthies and goals, you can use words to get almost anything \\nyou want. On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior \\nor speak ill of a noble’s allies, your efforts to convince or \\ndeceive will fall short.\\nAbility Checks\\nIn addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in deter -\\nmining the outcome of an interaction.\\n Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC’s attitude, but \\nthere might still be an element of chance in the situation. \\nFor example, your DM can call for a Charisma check at \\nany point during an interaction if he or she wants the dice \\nto play a role in determining an NPC’s reactions. Other \\nchecks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your \\nDM’s discretion.\\n Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking \\nof how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the \\ndeck in your favor by using an approach that relies on \\nyour best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to trick a \\nguard into letting them into a castle, the rogue who is pro -\\nficient in Deception is the best bet to lead the discussion. \\nWhen negotiating for a hostage’s release, the cleric with \\nPersuasion should do most of the talking.Resting\\nHeroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend \\nevery hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social in -\\nteraction, and combat. They need rest—time to sleep and \\neat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for \\nspellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure. \\n Adventurers, as well as other creatures, can take short \\nrests in the midst of a day and a long rest to end it.\\nShort Rest\\nA short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, \\nduring which a character does nothing more strenuous \\nthan eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.\\n A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end \\nof a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of \\nHit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level. For each \\nHit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds \\nthe character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character \\nregains hit points equal to the total (minimum of 0). The \\nplayer can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after \\neach roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon \\nfinishing a long rest, as explained below.\\nLong Rest\\nA long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 \\nhours long, during which a character sleeps for at least \\n6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light ac -\\ntivity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. \\nIf the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activ -\\nity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or \\nsimilar adventuring activity—the characters must begin \\nthe rest again to gain any benefit from it.\\n At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost \\nhit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up \\nto a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total \\nnumber of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a \\ncharacter has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four \\nspent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.\\n A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest \\nin a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least \\n1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.\\nBetween Adventures\\nBetween trips to dungeons and battles against ancient \\nevils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and \\nprepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also \\nuse this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting \\narms and armor, performing research, or spending \\ntheir hard-earned gold.\\n In some cases, the passage of time is something that \\noccurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a \\nnew adventure, the DM might simply declare that a cer -\\ntain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe \\nin general terms what your character has  \\nbeen doing. At other times, the DM might want to keep \\ntrack of just how much time is passing as events beyond \\nyour perception stay in motion.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 70}, page_content='7171 Chapter 8: Adventuring\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Lifestyle Expenses\\nBetween adventures, you choose a particular quality of \\nlife and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as de -\\nscribed in chapter 5. \\n Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect \\non your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way \\nother individuals and groups react to you. For example, \\nwhen you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier \\nfor you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live \\nin poverty.\\nDowntime Activities\\nBetween adventures, the DM might ask you what your \\ncharacter is doing during his or her downtime. Periods \\nof downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime \\nactivity requires a certain number of days to complete \\nbefore you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each \\nday must be spent on the downtime activity for the day \\nto count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you \\nhave more than the minimum amount of days to spend, \\nyou can keep doing the same thing for a longer period \\nof time, or switch to a new downtime activity. \\n Downtime activities other than the ones presented be -\\nlow are possible. If you want your character to spend his \\nor her downtime performing an activity not covered here, \\ndiscuss it with your DM.\\nCrafting\\nYou can craft nonmagical objects, including adventur -\\ning equipment and works of art. You must be proficient \\nwith tools related to the object you are trying to create \\n(typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to \\nspecial materials or locations necessary to create it. For \\nexample, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a \\nforge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.\\n For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can \\ncraft one or more items with a total market value not ex -\\nceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth \\nhalf the total market value. If something you want to craft \\nhas a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress \\nevery day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market \\nvalue of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (mar -\\nket value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.\\n Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward \\nthe crafting of a single item, provided that the charac -\\nters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are \\nworking together in the same place. Each character con -\\ntributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to \\ncraft the item. For example, three characters with the req -\\nuisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a \\nsuit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.\\n While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle \\nwithout having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable \\nlifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5 for more \\ninformation on lifestyle expenses).\\nPracticing a Profession\\nYou can work between adventures, allowing you to main -\\ntain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day \\n(see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle expenses). \\nThis benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your \\nprofession. If you are a member of an organization that can pro -\\nvide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves’ \\nguild, you earn enough to support a comfortable life -\\nstyle instead.\\n If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put \\nyour performance skill to use during your downtime, you \\nearn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.\\nRecuperating\\nYou can use downtime between adventures to recover \\nfrom a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.\\n After three days of downtime spent recuperating, \\nyou can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. \\nOn a successful save, you can choose one of the \\nfollowing results:\\n• End one effect on you that prevents you from regain -\\ning hit points.\\n• For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws \\nagainst one disease or poison currently  \\naffecting you.\\nResearching\\nThe time between adventures is a great chance to per -\\nform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have \\nunfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can \\ninclude poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls \\nin a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors \\nand gossip from their lips.\\n When you begin your research, the DM determines \\nwhether the information is available, how many days of \\ndowntime it will take to find it, and whether there are any \\nrestrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out \\na specific individual, tome, or location). The DM might \\nalso require you to make one or more ability checks, \\nsuch as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues \\npointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma \\n(Persuasion) check to secure someone’s aid. Once those \\nconditions are met, you learn the information if it is \\navailable.\\n For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover \\nyour expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal \\nlifestyle expenses (as discussed in chapter 5).\\nTraining\\nYou can spend time between adventures learning a new \\nlanguage or training with a set of tools. Your DM might \\nallow additional training options.\\n First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. \\nThe DM determines how long it takes, and whether one \\nor more ability checks are required.\\n The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. \\nAfter you spend the requisite amount of time and money, \\nyou learn the new language or gain proficiency with \\nthe new tool.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 71}, page_content='7272 Chapter 9: Combat\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.The clatter of a sword striking against a shield. \\nThe terrible rending sound as monstrous claws tear \\nthrough armor. A brilliant flash of light as a ball of flame \\nblossoms from a wizard’s spell. The sharp tang of blood \\nin the air, cutting through the stench of vile monsters. \\nRoars of fury, shouts of triumph, cries of pain. Combat in \\nD&D can be chaotic, deadly, and thrilling.\\n This chapter provides the rules you need for your char -\\nacters and monsters to engage in combat, whether it is \\na brief skirmish or an extended conflict in a dungeon or \\non a field of battle. Throughout this chapter, the rules ad -\\ndress you, the player or Dungeon Master. The Dungeon \\nMaster controls all the monsters and nonplayer charac -\\nters involved in combat, and each other player controls an \\nadventurer. “You” can also mean the character or mon -\\nster that you control.\\nThe Order of Combat\\nA typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, \\na flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and \\nspellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat \\ninto a cycle of rounds and turns. A round  represents \\nabout 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each \\nparticipant in a battle takes a turn . The order of turns is \\ndetermined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when \\neveryone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, \\nthe fight continues to the next round if neither side has \\ndefeated the other.\\nSurprise\\nA band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, \\nspringing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous \\ncube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the \\nadventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these \\nsituations, one side of the battle gains surprise over \\nthe other.\\n The DM determines who might be surprised. If nei -\\nther side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice \\neach other. Otherwise, the DM compares the Dexterity \\n(Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wis -\\ndom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a \\nthreat is surprised at the start of the encounter.\\n If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action \\non your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a re -\\naction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be \\nsurprised even if the other members aren’t.\\nInitiative\\nInitiative determines the order of turns during combat. \\nWhen combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity \\ncheck to determine their place in the initiative order. The \\nDM makes one roll for an entire group of identical crea -\\ntures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.\\n The DM ranks the combatants in order from the one \\nwith the highest Dexterity check total to the one with \\nthe lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) \\nin which they act during each round. The initiative order \\nremains the same from round to round.\\n If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied \\nDM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the or -\\nder among their tied characters. The DM can decide the \\norder if the tie is between a monster and a player charac -\\nter. Optionally, the DM can have the tied characters and \\nmonsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest \\nroll going first.\\nYour Turn\\nOn your turn, you can move  a distance up to your speed \\nand take one action . You decide whether to move first or \\ntake your action first. Your speed—sometimes called your \\nwalking speed—is noted on your character sheet.\\n The most common actions you can take are described \\nin the “Actions in Combat” section later in this chapter. \\nMany class features and other abilities provide additional \\noptions for your action.\\n The “Movement and Position” section later in this chap -\\nter gives the rules for your move.\\n You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing any -\\nthing at all on your turn. If you can’t decide what to do on \\nyour turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as \\ndescribed in “Actions in Combat.”\\nBonus Actions\\nVarious class features, spells, and other abilities let you \\ntake an additional action on your turn called a bonus ac -\\ntion. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a \\nrogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action \\nonly when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the \\ngame states that you can do something as a bonus action. \\nYou otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.\\n You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you \\nmust choose which bonus action to use when you have \\nmore than one available.\\n You choose when to take a bonus action during your \\nturn, unless the bonus action’s timing is specified, and \\nanything that deprives you of your ability to take actions \\nalso prevents you from taking a bonus action.Chapter 9: Combat\\nCombat Step by Step\\n1. Determine surprise. The DM determines whether anyone \\ninvolved in the combat encounter is surprised.\\n2. Establish positions. The DM decides where all the \\ncharacters and monsters are located. Given the \\nadventurers’ marching order or their stated positions in \\nthe room or other location, the DM figures out where the \\nadversaries are—how far away and in what direction. \\n3. Roll initiative. Everyone involved in the combat \\nencounter rolls initiative, determining the order of \\ncombatants’ turns.\\n4. Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in \\ninitiative order.\\n5. Begin the next round. When everyone involved in the \\ncombat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 \\nuntil the fighting stops.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 72}, page_content='7373 Chapter 9: Combat\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Other Activity on Your Turn\\nYour turn can include a variety of flourishes that require \\nneither your action nor your move.\\n You can communicate however you are able, through \\nbrief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.\\n You can also interact with one object or feature of the \\nenvironment for free, during either your move or your \\naction. For example, you could open a door during your \\nmove as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your \\nweapon as part of the same action you use to attack.\\n If you want to interact with a second object, you need \\nto use your action. Some magic items and other special \\nobjects always require an action to use, as stated \\nin their descriptions.\\n The DM might require you to use an action for any  \\nof these activities when it needs special care or when it \\npresents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM \\ncould reasonably expect you to use an action to open a \\nstuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.\\nReactions\\nCertain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you \\nto take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is \\nan instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can \\noccur on your turn or on someone else’s. The opportunity \\nattack, described later in this chapter, is the most com -\\nmon type of reaction.\\n When you take a reaction, you can’t take another one \\nuntil the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts \\nanother creature’s turn, that creature can continue its \\nturn right after the reaction.\\nMovement and Position\\nIn combat, characters and monsters are in constant \\nmotion, often using movement and position to gain the \\nupper hand. On your turn, you can move a distance up to your \\nspeed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as \\nyou like on your turn, following the rules here.\\n Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and \\nswimming. These different modes of movement can be \\ncombined with walking, or they can constitute your entire \\nmove. However you’re moving, you deduct the distance of \\neach part of your move from your speed until it is used up \\nor until you are done moving.\\n The “Special Types of Movement” section in chap -\\nter 8 gives the particulars for jumping, climbing, \\nand swimming.\\nBreaking Up Your Move\\nYou can break up your movement on your turn, using \\nsome of your speed before and after your action. For \\nexample, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move \\n10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.\\nMoving between Attacks\\nIf you take an action that includes more than one weapon \\nattack, you can break up your movement even further by \\nmoving between those attacks. For example, a fighter \\nwho can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature \\nand who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make \\nan attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.\\nUsing Different Speeds\\nIf you have more than one speed, such as your walking \\nspeed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth \\nbetween your speeds during your move. Whenever you \\nswitch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved from \\nthe new speed. The result determines how much farther \\nyou can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the \\nnew speed during the current move.\\n For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying \\nspeed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly  spell on you, \\nyou could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into \\nthe air to fly 30 feet more.\\nDifficult Terrain\\nCombat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on fea -\\ntureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked \\nforests, treacherous staircases—the setting of \\na typical fight contains difficult terrain.\\n Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 \\nextra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in \\na space count as difficult terrain.\\n Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, \\nand shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The \\nspace of another creature, whether hostile or not, also \\ncounts as difficult terrain.\\nBeing Prone\\nCombatants often find themselves lying on the ground, \\neither because they are knocked down or because they \\nthrow themselves down. In the game, they are prone, \\na condition described in appendix A.\\n You can drop prone  without using any of your speed. \\nStanding up takes more effort; doing so costs an \\namount of movement equal to half your speed. For ex -\\nample, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet \\nInteracting with Objects Around You\\nHere are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in \\ntandem with your movement and action:\\n• draw or sheathe a sword\\n• open or close a door\\n• withdraw a potion from your backpack\\n• pick up a dropped axe\\n• take a bauble from a table\\n• remove a ring from your finger\\n• stuff some food into your mouth\\n• plant a banner in the ground\\n• fish a few coins from your belt pouch\\n• drink all the ale in a flagon\\n• throw a lever or a switch\\n• pull a torch from a sconce\\n• take a book from a shelf you can reach\\n• extinguish a small flame\\n• don a mask\\n• pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head\\n• put your ear to a door\\n• kick a small stone\\n• turn a key in a lock\\n• tap the floor with a 10-foot pole\\n• hand an item to another character'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 73}, page_content='7474 Chapter 9: Combat\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t \\nhave enough movement left or if your speed is 0.\\n To move while prone, you must crawl  or use magic \\nsuch as teleportation. Every foot of movement while \\ncrawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult \\nterrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.\\nMoving Around Other Creatures\\nYou can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In \\ncontrast, you can move through a hostile creature’s space \\nonly if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller \\nthan you. Remember that another creature’s space is dif -\\nficult terrain for you.\\n Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t \\nwillingly end your move in its space.\\n If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, \\nyou provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in \\nthe chapter.\\nFlying Movement\\nFlying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but \\nthey must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying \\ncreature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or \\nis otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature \\nfalls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held \\naloft by magic, such as by the fly  spell.\\nCreature Size\\nEach creature takes up a different amount of space. \\nThe Size Categories table shows how much space \\na creature of a particular size controls in combat. \\nObjects sometimes use the same size categories.\\nSize Categories\\nSize Space Example Monsters\\nTiny 2½ by 2½ ft. Imp, sprite\\nSmall 5 by 5 ft. Giant rat, goblin\\nMedium 5 by 5 ft. Orc, werewolf\\nLarge 10 by 10 ft. Hippogriff, ogre\\nHuge 15 by 15 ft. Fire giant, treant\\nGargantuan 20 by 20 ft. or larger Kraken, purple worm\\nSpace\\nA creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively \\ncontrols in combat, not an expression of its physical di -\\nmensions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, \\nfor example, but it does control a space that wide. If a \\nMedium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, \\nother creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin \\nlets them.\\n A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight \\neffectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number \\nof creatures that can surround another creature in com -\\nbat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can \\nfit in a 5-foot radius around another one.\\n Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer \\nof them can surround a creature. If four Large creatures \\ncrowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little \\nroom for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Me -\\ndium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.Squeezing into a Smaller Space\\nA creature can squeeze through a space that is large \\nenough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a \\nLarge creature can squeeze through a passage that’s only \\n5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature \\nmust spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and \\nit has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving \\nthrows. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage \\nwhile it’s in the smaller space.\\nActions in Combat\\nWhen you take your action on your turn, you can take one \\nof the actions presented here, an action you gained from \\nyour class or a special feature, or an action that you im -\\nprovise. Many monsters have action options of their own \\nin their stat blocks.\\n When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in \\nthe rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible \\nand what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to deter -\\nmine success or failure.\\nAttack\\nThe most common action to take in combat is the Attack \\naction, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an ar -\\nrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.\\n With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. \\nSee the “Making an Attack” section for the rules that gov -\\nern attacks.\\n Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature \\nof the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack \\nwith this action.\\nVariant: Playing on a Grid\\nIf you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures \\nor other tokens, follow these rules.\\n Squares. Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.\\n Speed. Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by \\nsquare on the grid. This means you use your speed in 5-foot \\nsegments. This is particularly easy if you translate your \\nspeed into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example, \\na speed of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.\\n If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in \\nsquares on your character sheet.\\n Entering a Square. To enter a square, you must have \\nat least 1 square of movement left, even if the square \\nis diagonally adjacent to the square you’re in. (The rule \\nfor diagonal movement sacrifices realism for the sake of \\nsmooth play. The Dungeon Master’s Guide provides guidance \\non using a more realistic approach.)\\n If a square costs extra movement, as a square of \\ndifficult terrain does, you must have enough movement \\nleft to pay for entering it. For example, you must have \\nat least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square of \\ndifficult terrain.\\n Corners. Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a \\nwall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.\\n Ranges. To determine the range on a grid between two \\nthings—whether creatures or objects—start counting \\nsquares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop \\ncounting in the space of the other one. Count by the \\nshortest route.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 74}, page_content='7575 Chapter 9: Combat\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Cast a Spell\\nSpellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many \\nmonsters, have access to spells and can use them to great \\neffect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which \\nspecifies whether the caster must use an action, a reac -\\ntion, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a \\nspell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells \\ndo have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often \\nuses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell. See \\nchapter 10 for the rules on spellcasting.\\nDash\\nWhen you take the Dash action, you gain extra move -\\nment for the current turn. The increase equals your \\nspeed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 \\nfeet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn \\nif you dash.\\n Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this \\nadditional movement by the same amount. If your speed \\nof 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move \\nup to 30 feet this turn if you dash.\\nDisengage\\nIf you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t \\nprovoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.\\nDodge\\nWhen you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on \\navoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any \\nattack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can \\nsee the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws \\nwith advantage. You lose this benefit if you are inca -\\npacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your speed \\ndrops to 0.\\nHelp\\nYou can lend your aid to another creature in the com -\\npletion of a task. When you take the Help action, the \\ncreature you aid gains advantage on the next ability \\ncheck it makes to perform the task you are helping with, \\nprovided that it makes the check before the start of your \\nnext turn.\\n Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attack -\\ning a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract \\nthe target, or in some other way team up to make your \\nally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target \\nbefore your next turn, the first attack roll is made with \\nadvantage.Hide\\nWhen you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity \\n(Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules \\nin chapter 7 for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain \\nbenefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and Tar -\\ngets” section later in this chapter.\\nReady\\nSometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a \\nparticular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can \\ntake the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act us -\\ning your reaction before the start of your next turn.\\n First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will \\ntrigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you \\nwill take in response to that trigger, or you choose to \\nmove up to your speed in response to it. Examples in -\\nclude “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the \\nlever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I \\nmove away.”\\n When the trigger occurs, you can either take your re -\\naction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. \\nRemember that you can take only one reaction per round.\\n When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold \\nits energy, which you release with your reaction when the \\ntrigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a cast -\\ning time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s magic \\nrequires concentration (explained in chapter 10). If your \\nconcentration is broken, the spell dissipates without tak -\\ning effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the \\nweb spell and ready magic missile , your web  spell ends, \\nand if you take damage before you release magic missile \\nwith your reaction, your concentration might be broken.\\nSearch\\nWhen you take the Search action, you devote your \\nattention to finding something. Depending on the na -\\nture of your search, the DM might have you make a \\nWisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investiga -\\ntion) check.\\nUse an Object\\nYou normally interact with an object while doing some -\\nthing else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an \\nattack. When an object requires your action for its use, \\nyou take the Use an Object action. This action is also use -\\nful when you want to interact with more than one object \\non your turn.\\nMaking an Attack\\nWhether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a \\nweapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a \\nspell, an attack has a simple structure.\\n1. Choose a target. Pick a target within your attack’s \\nrange: a creature, an object, or a location.\\n2. Determine modifiers. The DM determines whether \\nthe target has cover and whether you have advantage \\nor disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, \\nImprovising an Action\\nYour character can do things not covered by the actions in \\nthis chapter, such as breaking down doors, intimidating \\nenemies, sensing weaknesses in magical defenses, or \\ncalling for a parley with a foe. The only limits to the actions \\nyou can attempt are your imagination and your character’s \\nability scores. See the descriptions of the ability scores in \\nchapter 7 for inspiration as you improvise.\\n When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in \\nthe rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible \\nand what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine \\nsuccess or failure.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 75}, page_content='7676 Chapter 9: Combat\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Resolve the attack. You make the attack roll. On a hit, \\nyou roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules \\nthat specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special \\neffects in addition to or instead of damage.\\n If there’s ever any question whether something you’re \\ndoing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re \\nmaking an attack roll, you’re making an attack.\\nAttack Rolls\\nWhen you make an attack, your attack roll determines \\nwhether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, \\nroll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total \\nof the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s \\nArmor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character \\nis determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a \\nmonster is in its stat block.\\nModifiers to the Roll\\nWhen a character makes an attack roll, the two most \\ncommon modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier \\nand the character’s proficiency bonus. When a monster \\nmakes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is pro -\\nvided in its stat block.\\n Ability Modifier. The ability modifier used for a melee \\nweapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used \\nfor a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that \\nhave the finesse or thrown property break this rule.\\n Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability \\nmodifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcast -\\ning ability of the spellcaster, as explained in chapter 10.\\n Proficiency Bonus. You add your proficiency bonus \\nto your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with \\nwhich you have proficiency, as well as when you attack \\nwith a spell.\\nRolling 1 or 20\\nSometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing \\nthe novice to hit and the veteran to miss.\\n If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits re -\\ngardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called \\na critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.\\n If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses re -\\ngardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC.\\nUnseen Attackers and Targets\\nCombatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hid -\\ning, casting the invisibility  spell, or lurking in darkness.\\n When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have \\ndisadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether \\nyou’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting a \\ncreature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in the \\nlocation you targeted, you automatically miss, but the DM \\ntypically just says that the attack missed, not whether you \\nguessed the target’s location correctly.\\n When a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on \\nattack rolls against it.\\n If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when \\nyou make an attack, you give away your location when the \\nattack hits or misses.Ranged Attacks\\nWhen you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a \\ncrossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projec -\\ntiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot \\nspines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a \\nranged attack.\\nRange\\nYou can make ranged attacks only against targets within \\na specified range.\\n If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a \\nsingle range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.\\n Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a long -\\nbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number \\nis the normal range, and the larger number is the long \\nrange. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target \\nis beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target be -\\nyond the long range.\\nRanged Attacks in Close Combat\\nAiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe \\nis next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a \\nweapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvan -\\ntage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile \\ncreature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated.\\nMelee Attacks\\nUsed in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you \\nto attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically \\nuses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warham -\\nmer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack \\nwhen it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or \\nother body part. A few spells also involve making a me -\\nlee attack.\\n Most creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus at -\\ntack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee \\nattack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than \\nMedium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 \\nfeet, as noted in their descriptions.\\n Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon \\nattack, you can use an unarmed strike : a punch, kick, \\nhead-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count \\nas weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeon -\\ning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are \\nproficient with your unarmed strikes.\\nOpportunity Attacks\\nIn a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies \\nto drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly past \\nyour foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so \\nprovokes an opportunity attack.\\n You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile \\ncreature that you can see moves out of your reach. To \\nmake the opportunity attack, you use your reaction \\nto make one melee attack against the provoking crea -\\nture. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves \\nyour reach.\\n You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by \\ntaking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an \\nopportunity attack when you teleport or when someone \\nor something moves you without using your movement, \\naction, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an '),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 76}, page_content='7777 Chapter 9: Combat\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

A target has half cover if an ob -\\nstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might \\nbe a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree \\ntrunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy \\nor a friend.\\n A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to \\nAC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quar -\\nters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an \\nobstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow \\nslit, or a thick tree trunk.\\n A target with total cover can’t be targeted directly by \\nan attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such \\na target by including it in an area of effect. A target has \\ntotal cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.\\nDamage and Healing\\nInjury and the risk of death are constant companions \\nof those who explore the worlds of D&D. The thrust of \\na sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a \\nfireball  spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, \\nthe hardiest of creatures.\\nHit Points\\nHit points represent a combination of physical and men -\\ntal durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with \\nmore hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with \\nfewer hit points are more fragile.\\n A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit \\npoints) can be any number from the creature’s hit point \\nmaximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as \\na creature takes damage or receives healing.\\n Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is \\nsubtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has \\nno effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature \\ndrops to 0 hit points.\\nDamage Rolls\\nEach weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability speci -\\nfies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, \\nadd any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. \\nMagic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can \\ngrant a bonus to damage.\\n When attacking with a weapon , you add your ability \\nmodifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to \\nthe damage. A spell  tells you which dice to roll for dam -\\nage and whether to add any modifiers.\\n If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than \\none target  at the same time, roll the damage once for all \\nof them. For example, when a wizard casts fireball  or a opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s \\nreach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.\\nTwo-Weapon Fighting\\nWhen you take the Attack action and attack with a light \\nmelee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can \\nuse a bonus action to attack with a different light melee \\nweapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t \\nadd your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus at -\\ntack, unless that modifier is negative.\\n If either weapon has the thrown property, you can \\nthrow the weapon, instead of making a melee at -\\ntack with it.\\nGrappling\\nWhen you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you \\ncan use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, \\na grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the \\nAttack action, this attack replaces one of them.\\n The target of your grapple must be no more than one \\nsize larger than you, and it must be within your reach. \\nUsing at least one free hand, you try to seize the target \\nby making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) check \\ncontested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity \\n(Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). \\nYou succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If \\nyou succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condi -\\ntion (see appendix A). The condition specifies the things \\nthat end it, and you can release the target whenever you \\nlike (no action required).\\n Escaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its \\naction to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength \\n(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by \\nyour Strength (Athletics) check.\\n Moving a Grappled Creature. When you move, you \\ncan drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but \\nyour speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more \\nsizes smaller than you.\\nShoving a Creature\\nUsing the Attack action, you can make a special melee at -\\ntack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push \\nit away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks \\nwith the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\\n The target of your shove must be no more than one \\nsize larger than you, and it must be within your reach. \\nYou make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by \\nthe target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobat -\\nics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You \\nsucceed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If \\nyou succeed, you either knock the target prone or push \\nit 5 feet away from you.\\nCover\\nWalls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide \\ncover during combat, making a target more difficult \\nto harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an \\nattack or other effect originates on the opposite side of \\nthe cover.\\n There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind \\nmultiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree \\nof cover applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For \\nexample, if a target is behind a creature that gives half \\nContests in Combat\\nBattle often involves pitting your prowess against that of \\nyour foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This \\nsection includes the most common contests that require an \\naction in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The DM \\ncan use these contests as models for improvising others.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 77}, page_content='7878 Chapter 9: Combat\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Damage Resistance and \\nVulnerability\\nSome creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or \\nunusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.\\n If a creature or an object has resistance  to a damage \\ntype, damage of that type is halved against it. If a crea -\\nture or an object has vulnerability  to a damage type, \\ndamage of that type is doubled against it.\\n Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all \\nother modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has \\nresistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack \\nthat deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also \\nwithin a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The \\n25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the \\ncreature takes 10 damage.\\n Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that \\naffect the same damage type count as only one instance. \\nFor example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage \\nas well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the dam -\\nage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the \\ncreature, not reduced by three-quarters.cleric casts flame strike , the spell’s damage is rolled once \\nfor all creatures caught in the blast.\\nCritical Hits\\nWhen you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice \\nfor the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the \\nattack’s damage dice twice and add them together. Then \\nadd any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, \\nyou can roll all the damage dice at once.\\n For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, \\nroll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add \\nyour relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other \\ndamage dice, such as from the rogue’s Sneak Attack fea -\\nture, you roll those dice twice as well.\\nDamage Types\\nDifferent attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful \\neffects deal different types of damage. Damage types have \\nno rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage re -\\nsistance, rely on the types.\\n The damage types follow, with examples to help a \\nDM assign a damage type to a new effect.\\n Acid. The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath \\nand the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding \\ndeal acid damage.\\n Bludgeoning. Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling, \\nconstriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.\\n Cold. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s \\nspear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath \\ndeal cold damage.\\n Fire. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells con -\\njure flames to deal fire damage.\\n Force. Force is pure magical energy focused into a \\ndamaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are \\nspells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon .\\n Lightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon’s \\nbreath deal lightning damage.\\n Necrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead \\nand some spells, withers matter and even the soul.\\n Piercing. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including \\nspears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.\\n Poison.  Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green \\ndragon’s breath deal poison damage.\\n Psychic. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic \\nblast deal psychic damage.\\n Radiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s flame \\nstrike  spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh \\nlike fire and overloads the spirit with power.\\n Slashing. Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal \\nslashing damage.\\n Thunder. A concussive burst of sound, such as the ef -\\nfect of the thunderwave  spell, deals thunder damage.\\nDescribing the Effects of Damage\\nDungeon Masters describe hit point loss in different ways. \\nWhen your current hit point total is half or more of your \\nhit point maximum, you typically show no signs of injury. \\nWhen you drop below half your hit point maximum, you \\nshow signs of wear, such as cuts and bruises. An attack \\nthat reduces you to 0 hit points strikes you directly, leaving \\na bleeding injury or other trauma, or it simply knocks you \\nunconscious.RICHARD WHITTERS'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 78}, page_content='7979 Chapter 9: Combat\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Falling Unconscious\\nIf damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, \\nyou fall unconscious (see appendix A). This unconscious -\\nness ends if you regain any hit points.\\nDeath Saving Throws\\nWhenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must \\nmake a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, \\nto determine whether you creep closer to death or hang \\nonto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to \\nany ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided \\nonly by spells and features that improve your chances of \\nsucceeding on a saving throw.\\n Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. \\nOtherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect \\nby itself. On your third success, you become stable (see \\nbelow). On your third failure, you die. The successes \\nand failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track \\nof both until you collect three of a kind. The number of \\nboth is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or be -\\ncome stable.\\n Rolling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw \\nand roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you \\nroll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.\\n Damage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while \\nyou have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw \\nfailure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two \\nfailures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit \\npoint maximum, you suffer instant death.\\nStabilizing a Creature\\nThe best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to \\nheal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at \\nleast be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death \\nsaving throw.\\n You can use your action to administer first aid to an \\nunconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which \\nrequires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.\\n A stable  creature doesn’t make death saving throws, \\neven though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain un -\\nconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must \\nstart making death saving throws again, if it takes any \\ndamage. A stable creature that isn’t healed regains \\n1 hit point after 1d4 hours.\\nMonsters and Death\\nMost DMs have a monster die the instant it drops to  \\n0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and \\nmake death saving throws.\\n Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are \\ncommon exceptions; the DM might have them fall uncon -\\nscious and follow the same rules as player characters.\\nKnocking a Creature Out\\nSometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather \\nthan deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a \\ncreature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker \\ncan knock the creature out. The attacker can make this \\nchoice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls \\nunconscious and is stable.Healing\\nUnless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even \\ndeath is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can \\nrestore a creature’s hit points (as explained in chapter 8), \\nand magical methods such as a cure wounds  spell or a \\npotion of healing can remove damage in an instant.\\n When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points \\nregained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s \\nhit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit \\npoints regained in excess of this number are lost. For \\nexample, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. \\nIf the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point \\nmaximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the \\ndruid, not 8.\\n A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until \\nmagic such as the revivify  spell has restored it to life.\\nDropping to 0 Hit Points\\nWhen you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or \\nfall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.\\nInstant Death\\nMassive damage can kill you instantly. When dam -\\nage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage \\nremaining, you die if the remaining damage equals \\nor exceeds your hit point maximum.\\n For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points \\ncurrently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from \\nan attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage \\nremains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit \\npoint maximum, the cleric dies.RICHARD WHITTERS'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 79}, page_content='8080 Chapter 9: Combat\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Temporary Hit Points\\nSome spells and special abilities confer temporary hit \\npoints to a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual \\nhit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit \\npoints that protect you from injury.\\n When you have temporary hit points and take damage, \\nthe temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover \\ndamage carries over to your normal hit points. For \\nexample, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take \\n7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then \\ntake 2 damage.\\n Because temporary hit points are separate from your \\nactual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maxi -\\nmum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and \\nreceive temporary hit points.\\n Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they \\ncan’t be added together. If you have temporary hit points \\nand receive more of them, you decide whether to keep \\nthe ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, \\nif a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you \\nalready have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.\\n If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points \\ndoesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. \\nThey can still absorb damage directed at you while you’re \\nin that state, but only true healing can save you.\\n Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points \\nhas a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you fin -\\nish a long rest.\\nMounted Combat\\nA knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard \\ncasting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soar -\\ning through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of \\nspeed and mobility that a mount can provide. \\n A willing creature that is at least one size larger than \\nyou and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a \\nmount, using the following rules.\\nMounting and Dismounting\\nOnce during your move, you can mount a creature that \\nis within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an \\namount of movement equal to half your speed. For ex -\\nample, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet \\nof movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t \\nmount it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or \\nif your speed is 0.\\n If an effect moves your mount against its will while \\nyou’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity sav -\\ning throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space \\nwithin 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone while mounted, \\nyou must make the same saving throw.\\n If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your \\nreaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. \\nOtherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a \\nspace within 5 feet it.Controlling a Mount\\nWhile you’re mounted, you have two options. You can \\neither control the mount or allow it to act independently. \\nIntelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.\\n You can control a mount only if it has been trained to \\naccept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and sim -\\nilar creatures are assumed to have such training. The \\ninitiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours \\nwhen you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has \\nonly three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A \\ncontrolled mount can move and act even on the turn that \\nyou mount it.\\n An independent mount retains its place in the initiative \\norder. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions \\nthe mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It \\nmight flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly \\ninjured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.\\n  In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity \\nattack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you or \\nthe mount.\\nUnderwater Combat\\nWhen adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their under -\\nsea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or \\nfind themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must \\nfight in a challenging environment. Underwater the fol -\\nlowing rules apply.\\n When making a melee weapon attack , a creature that \\ndoesn’t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted \\nby magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the \\nweapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.\\n A ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target \\nbeyond the weapon’s normal range. Even against a target \\nwithin normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage un -\\nless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is \\nthrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).\\n Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water \\nhave resistance to fire damage.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 80}, page_content='D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Manipulating the fabric of magic and \\nchanneling its energy into even a simple spell is phys -\\nically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are \\neven more so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description \\nincludes a table showing how many spell slots of each \\nspell level a character can use at each character level. For \\nexample, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level \\nspell slots and two 2nd-level slots.\\n When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a \\nslot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot \\nwith the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of \\na certain size—small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell \\nof higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, \\nbut a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when \\nUmara casts magic missile, a 1st-level spell, she spends \\none of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining. \\n Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots \\n(see chapter 8 for the rules on resting).\\n Some characters and monsters have special abilities \\nthat let them cast spells without using spell slots.\\nCasting a Spell at a Higher Level\\nWhen a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a \\nhigher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher \\nlevel for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts magic \\nmissile  using one of her 2nd-level slots, that magic mis -\\nsile is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the \\nslot it is put into.\\n Some spells, such as magic missile and cure wounds , \\nhave more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as \\ndetailed in a spell’s description.\\nCantrips\\nA cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using \\na spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Re -\\npeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster’s mind \\nand infused the caster with the magic needed to produce \\nthe effect over and over. A cantrip’s spell level is 0.\\nRituals\\nCertain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell  \\ncan be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, \\nor the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a \\nspell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal.  \\nIt also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual \\nversion of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.\\n To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a \\nfeature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the \\ndruid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must \\nalso have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells \\nknown, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies oth -\\nerwise, as the wizard’s does.Magic permeates the worlds of D&D and most often \\nappears in the form of a spell.\\n This chapter provides the rules for casting spells. \\nDifferent character classes have distinctive ways of \\nlearning and preparing their spells, and monsters \\nuse spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, \\na spell follows the rules here.\\nWhat Is a Spell?\\nA spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of \\nthe magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a \\nspecific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a charac -\\nter carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic \\nsuffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular \\npattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then re -\\nleases them to unleash the desired effect—in most cases, \\nall in the span of seconds.\\n Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective \\nwards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or re -\\nmove conditions (see appendix A), drain life energy away, \\nand restore life to the dead.\\n Uncounted thousands of spells have been created \\nover the course of the multiverse’s history, and many of \\nthem are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in \\ncrumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped \\nin the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be re -\\ninvented by a character who has amassed enough power \\nand wisdom to do so.\\nSpell Level\\nEvery spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a gen -\\neral indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but \\nstill impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the incredi -\\nble time stop at 9th. Cantrips—simple but powerful spells \\nthat characters can cast almost by rote—are level 0. The \\nhigher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must \\nbe to use that spell.\\n Spell level and character level don’t correspond di -\\nrectly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, \\nnot 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.\\nKnown and Prepared Spells\\nBefore a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have \\nthe spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the \\nspell in a magic item. Members of a few classes have a \\nlimited list of spells they know that are always fixed in \\nmind. The same thing is true of many magic-using mon -\\nsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, \\nundergo a process of preparing spells. This process var -\\nies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.\\n In every case, the number of spells a caster can have \\nfixed in mind at any given time depends on the charac -\\nter’s level.Chapter 10: Spellcasting'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 82}, page_content='8383 Chapter 10: Spellcasting\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Components\\nA spell’s components are the physical requirements you \\nmust meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description \\nindicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), \\nor material (M) components. If you can’t provide one \\nor more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast \\nthe spell.\\nVerbal (V)\\nMost spells require the chanting of mystic words. The \\nwords themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; \\nrather, the particular combination of sounds, with spe -\\ncific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in \\nmotion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area \\nof silence, such as one created by the silence  spell, can’t \\ncast a spell with a verbal component.\\nSomatic (S)\\nSpellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticula -\\ntion or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a \\nsomatic component, the caster must have free use of at \\nleast one hand to perform these gestures.\\nMaterial (M)\\nCasting some spells requires particular objects, specified \\nin parentheses in the component entry. A character can \\nuse a component pouch  or a spellcasting focus  (found \\nin chapter 5) in place of the components specified for a \\nspell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a char -\\nacter must have that specific component before he or she \\ncan cast the spell.\\n If a spell states that a material component is consumed \\nby the spell, the caster must provide this component for \\neach casting of the spell.\\n A spellcaster must have a hand free to access these \\ncomponents—or to hold a spellcasting focus—but it can \\nbe the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic \\ncomponents.\\nDuration\\nA spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists. \\nA duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, \\nor even years. Some spells specify that their effects last \\nuntil the spells are dispelled or destroyed.\\nInstantaneous\\nMany spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, \\ncreates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that \\ncan’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for \\nan instant.\\nConcentration\\nSome spells require you to maintain concentration in or -\\nder to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, \\nsuch a spell ends.\\n If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that \\nfact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies \\nhow long you can concentrate on it. You can end concen -\\ntration at any time (no action required).Casting a Spell\\nWhen a character casts any spell, the same basic rules \\nare followed, regardless of the character’s class or the \\nspell’s effects.\\n Each spell description in chapter 11 begins with a block \\nof information, including the spell’s name, level, school of \\nmagic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The \\nrest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.\\nCasting Time\\nMost spells require a single action to cast, but some \\nspells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more \\ntime to cast.\\nBonus Action\\nA spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You \\nmust use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, \\nprovided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action \\nthis turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same \\nturn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.\\nReactions\\nSome spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take \\na fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in re -\\nsponse to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, \\nthe spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.\\nLonger Casting Times\\nCertain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require \\nmore time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast \\na spell with a casting time longer than a single action or \\nreaction, you must spend your action each turn casting \\nthe spell, and you must maintain your concentration \\nwhile you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your con -\\ncentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend \\na spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you \\nmust start over.\\nRange\\nThe target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For \\na spell like magic missile , the target is a creature. For a \\nspell like fireball , the target is the point in space where \\nthe ball of fire erupts.\\n Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells \\ncan target only a creature (including you) that you touch. \\nOther spells, such as the shield  spell, affect only you. \\nThese spells have a range of self.\\n Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate \\nfrom you also have a range of self, indicating that the or -\\nigin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see “Areas of \\nEffect” later in the this chapter).\\n Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range, \\nunless the spell’s description says otherwise.\\nCasting in Armor\\nBecause of the mental focus and precise gestures required \\nfor spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you \\nare wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted \\nand physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 83}, page_content='8484 Chapter 10: Spellcasting\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.location isn’t included in the spell’s area. To block one of \\nthese imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total \\ncover, as explained in chapter 9.\\nCone\\nA cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of \\norigin. A cone’s width at a given point along its length is \\nequal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. A \\ncone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.\\n A cone’s point of origin is not included in the cone’s \\narea of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\\nCube\\nYou select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere \\non a face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed \\nas the length of each side.\\n A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s \\narea of effect, unless you decide otherwise. Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t \\ninterfere with concentration. The following factors can \\nbreak concentration:\\n• Casting another spell that requires concentration. \\nYou lose concentration on a spell if you cast another \\nspell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate \\non two spells at once.\\n• Taking damage.  Whenever you take damage while \\nyou are concentrating on a spell, you must make a \\nConstitution saving throw to maintain your concentra -\\ntion. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, \\nwhichever number is higher. If you take damage from \\nmultiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s \\nbreath, you make a separate saving throw for each \\nsource of damage.\\n• Being incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration \\non a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.\\n The DM might also decide that certain environmental \\nphenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while \\nyou’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a \\nDC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentra -\\ntion on a spell.\\nTargets\\nA typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets \\nto be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell’s description \\ntells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a \\npoint of origin for an area of effect (described below).\\n Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might \\nnot know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like \\ncrackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, \\nsuch as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically \\ngoes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.\\nA Clear Path to the Target\\nTo target something, you must have a clear path to it, \\nso it can’t be behind total cover.\\n If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t \\nsee and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you \\nand that point, the point of origin comes into being on the \\nnear side of that obstruction.\\nTargeting Yourself\\nIf a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can \\nchoose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or \\nspecifically a creature other than you. If you are in the \\narea of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.\\nAreas of Effect\\nSpells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an \\narea, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.\\n A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which \\ntypically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cyl -\\ninder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of \\norigin , a location from which the spell’s energy erupts. \\nThe rules for each shape specify how you position its \\npoint of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in \\nspace, but some spells have an area whose origin is a \\ncreature or an object.\\n A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point \\nof origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the \\npoint of origin to a location within the area of effect, that \\nThe Schools of Magic\\nAcademies of magic group spells into eight categories \\ncalled schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, \\napply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic \\nfunctions in essentially the same way, whether it derives \\nfrom rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.\\n The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no \\nrules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.\\n Abjuration spells are protective in nature, though some \\nof them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, \\nnegate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish \\ncreatures to other planes of existence.\\n Conjuration spells involve the transportation of objects \\nand creatures from one location to another. Some spells \\nsummon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas \\nothers allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some \\nconjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.\\n Divination spells reveal information, whether in the \\nform of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the \\nlocations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or \\nvisions of distant people or places.\\n Enchantment spells affect the minds of others, \\ninfluencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can \\nmake enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to \\ntake a course of action, or even control another creature \\nlike a puppet.\\n Evocation spells manipulate magical energy to produce \\na desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. \\nOthers channel positive energy to heal wounds.\\n Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They \\ncause people to see things that are not there, to miss things \\nthat are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember \\nthings that never happened. Some illusions create phantom \\nimages that any creature can see, but the most insidious \\nillusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.\\n Necromancy spells manipulate the energies of life and \\ndeath. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, \\ndrain the life energy from another creature, create the \\nundead, or even bring the dead back to life.\\n Creating the undead through the use of necromancy \\nspells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil \\ncasters use such spells frequently.\\n Transmutation spells change the properties of a creature, \\nobject, or environment. They might turn an enemy into \\na harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make \\nan object move at the caster’s command, or enhance \\na creature’s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover \\nfrom injury.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 84}, page_content='8585 Chapter 10: Spellcasting\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Cylinder\\nA cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a \\nparticular radius, as given in the spell description. The \\ncircle must either be on the ground or at the height of the \\nspell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight \\nlines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the cir -\\ncle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect \\nthen shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a \\ndistance equal to the height of the cylinder.\\n A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s \\narea of effect.\\nLine\\nA line extends from its point of origin in a straight path \\nup to its length and covers an area defined by its width.\\n A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area \\nof effect, unless you decide otherwise.\\nSphere\\nYou select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere \\nextends outward from that point. The sphere’s size is ex -\\npressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.\\n A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s \\narea of effect.\\nSaving Throws\\nMany spells specify that a target can make a saving \\nthrow to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell \\nspecifies the ability that the target uses for the save and \\nwhat happens on a success or failure.\\n The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your \\nspellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + \\nany special modifiers.\\nAttack Rolls\\nSome spells require the caster to make an attack roll \\nto determine whether the spell effect hits the intended \\ntarget. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your \\nspellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.\\n Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged \\nattacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a \\nranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile \\ncreature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated (see \\nchapter 9).Combining Magical Effects\\nThe effects of different spells add together while the du -\\nrations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same \\nspell cast multiple times don’t combine, however. Instead, \\nthe most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from \\nthose castings applies while their durations overlap. Or \\nthe most recent effect applies if the castings are equally \\npotent and their durations overlap.\\n For example, if two clerics cast bless  on the same tar -\\nget, that character gains the spell’s benefit only once; he \\nor she doesn’t get to roll two bonus dice.\\nThe Weave of Magic\\nThe worlds within the D&D multiverse are magical \\nplaces. All existence is suffused with magical power, and \\npotential energy lies untapped in every rock, stream, and \\nliving creature, and even in the air itself. Raw magic is the \\nstuff of creation, the mute and mindless will of existence, \\npermeating every bit of matter and present in every \\nmanifestation of energy throughout the multiverse.\\n Mortals can’t directly shape this raw magic. Instead, they \\nmake use of a fabric of magic, a kind of interface between \\nthe will of a spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic. The \\nspellcasters of the Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and \\nrecognize its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters \\nhave varied ways of naming and visualizing this interface. \\nBy any name, without the Weave, raw magic is locked away \\nand inaccessible; the most powerful archmage can’t light \\na candle with magic in an area where the Weave has been \\ntorn. But surrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape \\nlightning to blast foes, transport hundreds of miles in the \\nblink of an eye, or even reverse death itself. \\n All magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds \\nof magic access it in a variety of ways. The spells of wizards, \\nwarlocks, sorcerers, and bards are commonly called arcane \\nmagic. These spells rely on an understanding—learned or \\nintuitive—of the workings of the Weave. The caster plucks \\ndirectly at the strands of the Weave to create the desired \\neffect. Eldritch knights and arcane tricksters also use arcane \\nmagic. The spells of clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers \\nare called divine magic. These spellcasters’ access to the \\nWeave is mediated by divine power—gods, the divine forces \\nof nature, or the sacred weight of a paladin’s oath.\\n Whenever a magic effect is created, the threads of \\nthe Weave intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect \\npossible. When characters use divination spells such as \\ndetect magic or identify, they glimpse the Weave. A spell such \\nas dispel magic smooths the Weave. Spells such as antimagic \\nfield rearrange the Weave so that magic flows around, \\nrather than through, the area affected by the spell. And in \\nplaces where the Weave is damaged or torn, magic works in \\nunpredictable ways—or not at all.\\nRICHARD WHITTERS'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 85}, page_content='8686 Chapter 11: Spells\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Any active spell or other magical effect on a \\ncreature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while \\nthe creature or object is in it.\\n Magic Items. The properties and powers of magic \\nitems are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a \\n+1 longsword  in the sphere functions as a nonmagical \\nlongsword.\\n A magic weapon’s properties and powers are sup -\\npressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or \\nwielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon \\nor a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere \\n(for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic \\nspear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the \\nitem ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.\\n Magical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel fail to \\nwork in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination \\nor the departure point for such magical travel. A portal \\nto another location, world, or plane of existence, as well \\nas an opening to an extradimensional space such as that \\ncreated by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while \\nin the sphere.\\n Creatures and Objects.  A creature or object sum -\\nmoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of \\nexistence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reap -\\npears once the space the creature occupied is no longer \\nwithin the sphere.\\n Dispel Magic.  Spells and magical effects such as dispel \\nmagic  have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres \\ncreated by different antimagic field spells don’t nullify \\neach other.\\nArcane Eye\\n4th-level divination\\nCasting Time:  1 action\\nRange:  30 feet\\nComponents:  V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)\\nDuration:  Concentration, up to 1 hour\\nYou create an invisible, magical eye within range that \\nhovers in the air for the duration.\\n You mentally receive visual information from the eye, \\nwhich has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. \\nThe eye can look in every direction.\\n As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in \\nany direction. There is no limit to how far away from \\nyou the eye can move, but it can’t enter another plane of \\nexistence. A solid barrier blocks the eye’s movement, but \\nthe eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch \\nin diameter.\\nArcane Lock\\n2nd-level abjuration\\nCasting Time:  1 action\\nRange:  Touch\\nComponents:  V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, \\nwhich the spell consumes)\\nDuration:  Until dispelled\\nYou touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other en -\\ntryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and \\nthe creatures you designate when you cast this spell can \\nopen the object normally. You can also set a password \\nthat, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses \\nthis spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable Spell Descriptions\\nThe spells are presented in alphabetical order. \\nAcid Splash\\nConjuration cantrip\\nCasting Time:  1 action\\nRange:  60 feet\\nComponents:  V, S\\nDuration:  Instantaneous\\nYou hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one or two creatures \\nyou can see within range. If you choose two, they must \\nbe within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a \\nDexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage.\\n This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach \\n5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).\\nAid\\n2nd-level abjuration\\nCasting Time:  1 action\\nRange:  30 feet\\nComponents:  V, S, M (a tiny strip of white cloth)\\nDuration:  8 hours\\nYour spell bolsters your allies with toughness and re -\\nsolve. Choose up to three creatures within range. Each \\ntarget’s hit point maximum and current hit points in -\\ncrease by 5 for the duration.\\n At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a \\nspell slot of 3rd level or higher, a target’s hit points in -\\ncrease by an additional 5 for each slot level above 2nd.\\nAntimagic Field\\n8th-level abjuration\\nCasting Time:  1 action\\nRange:  Self (10-foot-radius sphere)\\nComponents:  V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or \\niron filings)\\nDuration:  Concentration, up to 1 hour\\nA 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds \\nyou. This area is divorced from the magical energy that \\nsuffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can’t \\nbe cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic \\nitems become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere \\nmoves with you, centered on you.\\n Spells and other magical effects, except those created \\nby an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere \\nand can’t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a sup -\\npressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, \\nit doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed \\ncounts against its duration.\\n Targeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, \\nsuch as magic missile and charm person , that target \\na creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on \\nthat target.\\n Areas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical \\neffect, such as fireball , can’t extend into the sphere. If the \\nsphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area \\nthat is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, \\nthe flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within \\nthe sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is \\nlarge enough.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 87}, page_content='8888 Chapter 11: Spells\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Choose any number \\nof creatures within range. For the duration, each target \\nhas advantage on Wisdom saving throws and death \\nsaving throws, and regains the maximum number of hit \\npoints possible from any healing.\\nBlade Barrier\\n6th-level evocation\\nCasting Time:  1 action\\nRange:  90 feet\\nComponents:  V, S\\nDuration:  Concentration, up to 10 minutes\\nYou create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades \\nmade of magical energy. The wall appears within range \\nand lasts for the duration. You can make a straight wall \\nup to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a \\nringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 \\nfeet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cover to crea -\\ntures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.\\n When a creature enters the wall’s area for the first time \\non a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make \\na Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature \\ntakes 6d10 slashing damage. On a successful save, the \\ncreature takes half as much damage.until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. \\nCasting knock  on the object suppresses arcane lock for \\n10 minutes.\\n While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult \\nto break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any \\nlocks on it increases by 10.\\nAstral Projection\\n9th-level necromancy\\nCasting Time:  1 hour\\nRange:  10 feet\\nComponents:  V, S, M (for each creature you affect with \\nthis spell, you must provide one jacinth worth at least \\n1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at \\nleast 100 gp, all of which the spell consumes)\\nDuration:  Special\\nYou and up to eight willing creatures within range proj -\\nect your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell \\nfails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that \\nplane). The material body you leave behind is uncon -\\nscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t \\nneed food or air and doesn’t age.\\n Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost \\nevery way, replicating your game statistics and posses -\\nsions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery \\ncord that extends from between your shoulder blades and \\ntrails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This \\ncord is your tether to your material body. As long as the \\ntether remains intact, you can find your way home.

If you enter a new plane or return to the plane \\nyou were on when casting this spell, your body and pos -\\nsessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing \\nyou to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your \\nastral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other \\neffects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, \\nnor do they persist when you return to it.\\n The spell ends for you and your companions when \\nyou use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, \\nthe affected creature returns to its physical body, and \\nit awakens.\\n The spell might also end early for you or one of your \\ncompanions. A successful dispel magic spell used against \\nan astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. \\nIf a creature’s original body or its astral form drops to \\n0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell \\nends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the \\ncreature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of \\nsuspended animation.\\n If you are returned to your body prematurely, your com -\\npanions remain in their astral forms and must find their \\nown way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 \\nhit points.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 88}, page_content='8989 Chapter 11: Spells\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

The target also gains a climbing speed equal to its \\nwalking speed.\\nSpirit Guardians\\n3rd-level conjuration\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\nRange: Self (15-foot radius)\\nComponents:  V, S, M (a holy symbol)\\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\\nYou call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you \\nto a distance of 15 feet for the duration. If you are good or \\nneutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your \\nchoice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish.\\n When you cast this spell, you can designate any num -\\nber of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An \\naffected creature’s speed is halved in the area, and when \\nthe creature enters the area for the first time on a turn \\nor starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving \\nthrow. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant \\ndamage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic dam -\\nage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature \\ntakes half as much damage.\\n At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using a \\nspell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by \\n1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.\\nSpiritual Weapon\\n2nd-level evocation\\nCasting Time:  1 bonus action\\nRange: 60 feetComponents:  V, S, M (a bit of fleece)\\nDuration:  Concentration, up to 10 minutes\\nYou create the image of an object, a creature, or some \\nother visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot \\ncube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts \\nfor the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn’t accom -\\npanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.\\n You can use your action to cause the image to move to \\nany spot within range. As the image changes location, \\nyou can alter its appearance so that its movements ap -\\npear natural for the image. For example, if you create an \\nimage of a creature and move it, you can alter the image \\nso that it appears to be walking.\\n Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an \\nillusion, because things can pass through it. A creature \\nthat uses its action to examine the image can determine \\nthat it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Inves -\\ntigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature \\ndiscerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see \\nthrough the image.\\nSleep\\n1st-level enchantment\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\nRange:  90 feet\\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, \\nor a cricket)\\nDuration:  1 minute\\nThis spell sends creatures into a magical slumber.

If you target an object, it must be able \\nto fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can’t be held or \\ncarried by an unwilling creature.\\n The destination you choose must be known to you, and \\nit must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your \\nfamiliarity with the destination determines whether you \\narrive there successfully. The DM rolls d100 and consults \\nthe table.\\n Familiarity.  “Permanent circle” means a permanent \\nteleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. “As -\\nsociated object” means that you possess an object taken \\nfrom the desired destination within the last six months, \\nsuch as a book from a wizard’s library, bed linen from a \\nroyal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich’s secret tomb.\\n “Very familiar” is a place you have been very often, a \\nplace you have carefully studied, or a place you can see \\nwhen you cast the spell. “Seen casually” is someplace \\nyou have seen more than once but with which you aren’t \\nvery familiar. “Viewed once” is a place you have seen \\nonce, possibly using magic. “Description” is a place \\nwhose location and appearance you know through some -\\none else’s description, perhaps from a map.\\n “False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist. Per -\\nhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead \\nviewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a \\nfamiliar location that no longer exists.\\n On Target. You and your group (or the target object) \\nappear where you want to.\\n Off Target. You and your group (or the target object) \\nappear a random distance away from the destination in \\na random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 \\npercent of the distance that was to be traveled. For ex -\\nample, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, \\nand rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be Components: V, S\\nDuration: 1 minute\\nYou create a floating, spectral weapon within range that \\nlasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. \\nWhen you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell \\nattack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On \\na hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your \\nspellcasting ability modifier.\\n As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the \\nweapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a crea -\\nture within 5 feet of it.\\n The weapon can take whatever form you choose. \\nClerics of deities who are associated with a particular \\nweapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and \\nThor for his hammer) make this spell’s effect resemble \\nthat weapon.\\n At Higher Levels.

Crea -\\ntures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. \\nThe suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to \\nmake the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the \\ncreature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immo -\\nlate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends \\nthe spell.\\n The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a \\nfailed save, it pursues the course of action you described \\nto the best of its ability. The suggested course of action \\ncan continue for the entire duration. If the suggested ac -\\ntivity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends \\nwhen the subject finishes what it was asked to do.\\n You can also specify conditions that will trigger a spe -\\ncial activity during the duration. For example, you might \\nsuggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar \\nshe meets.

If the creature’s soul is free and willing, the creature \\nis restored to life with all its hit points.\\n This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, \\ncures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the crea -\\nture when it died.

The DM determines \\nthe direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and des -\\nignating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on \\naround the points of the compass. If you were teleporting \\nto a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you \\ncould be in trouble.\\n Similar Area.  You and your group (or the target object) \\nwind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically \\nsimilar to the target area. If you are heading for your \\nhome laboratory, for example, you might wind up in an -\\nother wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop \\nthat has many of the same tools and implements as your \\nlaboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar \\nplace, but since the spell has no range limit, you could \\nconceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\\n Mishap.  The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a \\ndifficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target \\nobject) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on \\nthe table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can \\noccur, dealing damage each time).\\nFamiliarity MishapSimilar \\nAreaOff \\nTargetOn \\nTarget\\nPermanent circle — — — 01–100\\nAssociated object — — — 01–100\\nVery familiar 01–05 06–13 14–24 25–100\\nSeen casually 01–33 34–43 44–53 54–100\\nViewed once 01–43 44–53 54–73 74–100\\nDescription 01–43 44–53 54–73 74–100\\nFalse destination 01–50 51–100 — —\\nThaumaturgy\\nTransmutation cantrip\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\nRange: 30 feet\\nComponents: V\\nDuration: Up to 1 minute\\nYou manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural \\npower, within range.

Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a \\nchasm or create a ramp.\\n If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you \\nmust halve the size of each panel to create supports. You \\ncan crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battle -\\nments, and so on.\\n The wall is an object made of stone that can be dam -\\naged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 \\nhit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit \\npoints destroys it and might cause connected panels to \\ncollapse at the DM’s discretion.\\n If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its \\nwhole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t \\nbe dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the \\nspell ends.\\nWarding Bond\\n2nd-level abjuration\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\nRange: Touch\\nComponents: V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at \\nleast 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear \\nfor the duration)\\nDuration: 1 hour\\nThis spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates \\na mystic connection between you and the target until the \\nspell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it \\ngains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has re -\\nsistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, \\nyou take the same amount of damage.\\n The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and \\nthe target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also \\nends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected \\ncreatures.

The webs fill a 20-foot cube \\nfrom that point for the duration. The webs are difficult \\nterrain and lightly obscure their area.\\n If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid masses \\n(such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or \\nceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell \\nends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a \\nflat surface have a depth of 5 feet.\\n Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that \\nenters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving \\nthrow. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long \\nas it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.\\n A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to \\nmake a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it \\nsucceeds, it is no longer restrained.\\n The webs are flammable.

The wall is opaque and \\nlasts for the duration.\\n When the wall appears, each creature within its area \\nmust make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a \\ncreature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage \\non a successful save.\\n One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this \\nspell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its \\nturn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall.

The wall is 6 inches \\nthick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. \\nEach panel must be contiguous with at least one other \\npanel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot pan -\\nels that are only 3 inches thick.\\n If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it ap -\\npears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your \\nchoice).

A monster is defined as any creature that can be \\ninteracted with and potentially fought and killed. Even \\nsomething as harmless as a frog or as benevolent as a \\nunicorn is a monster by this definition. The term also \\napplies to humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk who \\nmight be friends or rivals to the player characters.\\n This chapter presents a wide selection of ready-to-\\nplay monsters—a sample of what can be found in the \\nMonster Manual . Each description uses a standardized \\nformat that clearly explains the monster’s capabilities. \\nGuidelines for understanding the information found in a \\nmonster’s statistics are given below.\\nStatistics\\nA monster’s statistics, sometimes referred to as its stat \\nblock , provide the essential information that you need to \\nrun the monster.\\nSize\\nA monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or \\nGargantuan. See chapter 9 of this document for more in -\\nformation on creature size and space.\\nType\\nA monster’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Cer -\\ntain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects \\nin the game interact in special ways with creatures of a \\nparticular type. For example, an arrow of dragon slaying \\ndeals extra damage not only to dragons but also other \\ncreatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles \\nand wyverns.\\n The game includes the following monster types, which \\nhave no rules of their own.\\n Aberrations  are utterly alien beings. Many of them \\nhave innate magical abilities drawn from the creature’s \\nalien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. \\nThe quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, \\nmind flayers, and slaadi.\\n Beasts  are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural \\npart of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical \\npowers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society \\nor language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary ani -\\nmals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.\\n Celestials  are creatures native to the Upper Planes. \\nMany of them are the servants of deities, employed as \\nmessengers or agents in the mortal realm and through -\\nout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the \\nexceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment \\nis a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, \\nand pegasi.\\n Constructs are made, not born. Some are programmed \\nby their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, \\nwhile others are imbued with sentience and capable of \\nindependent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. \\nMany creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the \\nraw material of the plane by the will of more powerful \\ncreatures.\\n Dragons  are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin \\nand tremendous power. True dragons, including the good \\nmetallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are \\nhighly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this cat -\\negory are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but \\nless powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as \\nwyverns and pseudodragons.\\n Elementals are creatures native to the elemental \\nplanes. Some creatures of this type are little more than \\nanimate masses of their respective elements, including \\nthe creatures simply called elementals. Others have \\nbiological forms infused with elemental energy. The \\nraces of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most \\nimportant civilizations on the elemental planes. Other \\nelemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and \\nwater weirds.\\n Fey are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of \\nnature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. \\nIn some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also \\ncalled the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the \\nOuter Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the \\nBeastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.\\n Fiends are creatures of wickedness that are native \\nto the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, \\nbut many more labor under the leadership of archdevils \\nand demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes \\nsummon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. \\nIf an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost in -\\nconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, \\nrakshasas, and yugoloths.\\n Giants  tower over humans and their kind. They are \\nhumanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads \\n(ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of \\ntrue giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire \\ngiants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, \\ncreatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.\\n Humanoids  are the main peoples of the D&D world, \\nboth civilized and savage, including humans and a tre -\\nmendous variety of other species. They have language \\nand culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though \\nmost humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal \\nform. The most common humanoid races are the ones \\nmost suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, \\nelves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more \\nsavage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the \\nraces of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), \\norcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.\\n Monstrosities  are monsters in the strictest sense—\\nfrightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly \\nnatural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of \\nmagical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), \\nand others are the product of terrible curses (including \\nminotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in \\nsome sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures \\nthat don’t fit into any other type.Chapter 12: Monsters'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 110}, page_content='111111 Chapter 12: Monsters\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves \\nand dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or crea -\\ntures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings \\nand gelatinous cubes are among the most recogniz -\\nable oozes.\\n Plants  in this context are vegetable creatures, not or -\\ndinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are \\ncarnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling \\nmound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas \\nspore and the myconid also fall into this category.\\n Undead are once-living creatures brought to a horrify -\\ning state of undeath through the practice of necromantic \\nmagic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking \\ncorpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodi -\\nless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.\\nTags\\nA monster might have one or more tags appended to its \\ntype, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the human -\\noid (orc)  type. The parenthetical tags provide additional \\ncategorization for certain creatures. The tags have no \\nrules of their own, but something in the game, such as \\na magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear \\nthat is especially effective at fighting demons would work \\nagainst any monster that has the demon tag.\\nAlignment\\nA monster’s alignment provides a clue to its disposition \\nand how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. \\nFor example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult \\nto reason with and might attack characters on sight, \\nwhereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. \\nSee chapter 4 of this document for descriptions of the \\ndifferent alignments.\\n The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is \\nthe default. Feel free to depart from it and change a mon -\\nster’s alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you \\nwant a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, \\nthere’s nothing stopping you.\\n Some creatures can have any alignment . In other \\nwords, you choose the monster’s alignment. Some mon -\\nster’s alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion \\ntoward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker \\ncan be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neu -\\ntral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.\\n Many creatures of low intelligence have no compre -\\nhension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don’t make \\nmoral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These \\ncreatures are unaligned , which means they don’t have an \\nalignment.\\nArmor Class\\nA monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Ar -\\nmor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity \\ninto account. Otherwise, a monster’s AC is based on its \\nDexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster \\nhas natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this \\nis noted in parentheses after its AC value.Hit Points\\nA monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops \\nto 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see chapter 1 of \\nthis document .\\n A monster’s hit points are presented both as a die \\nexpression and as an average number. For example, a \\nmonster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on aver -\\nage (2 × 4½).\\n A monster’s size determines the die used to calculate \\nits hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.\\nHit Dice by Size\\nMonster Size Hit Die Average HP per Die\\nTiny d4 2½\\nSmall d6 3½\\nMedium d8 4½\\nLarge d10 5½\\nHuge d12 6½\\nGargantuan d20 10½\\n A monster’s Constitution modifier also affects the \\nnumber of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is \\nmultiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and \\nthe result is added to its hit points. For example, if a mon -\\nster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit \\nDice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).\\nSpeed\\nA monster’s speed tells you how far it can move on its \\nturn. For more information on speed, see chapter 8 and \\nchapter 9 of this document .\\n All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the \\nmonster’s speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-\\nbased locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.\\n Some creatures have one or more of the following addi -\\ntional movement modes.\\nBurrow\\nA monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed \\nto move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can’t \\nburrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait \\nthat allows it to do so.\\nClimb\\nA monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of \\nits movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster \\ndoesn’t need to spend extra movement to climb.\\nFly\\nA monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of \\nits movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to \\nhover , which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as \\nexplained in the rules on flying in chapter 9 of this docu -\\nment). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.\\nSwim\\nA monster that has a swimming speed doesn’t need to \\nspend extra movement to swim.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 111}, page_content='112112 Chapter 12: Monsters\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Ability Scores\\nEvery monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, \\nConstitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and \\ncorresponding modifiers. For more information on abil -\\nity scores and how they’re used in play, see chapter 7 of \\nthis document .\\nSaving Throws \\nThe Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that \\nare adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For exam -\\nple, a creature that isn’t easily charmed or frightened \\nmight gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most \\ncreatures don’t have special saving throw bonuses, in \\nwhich case this section is absent.\\n A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant \\nability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is deter -\\nmined by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the \\nProficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).\\nProficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating\\nChallengeProficiency\\nBonus ChallengeProficiency\\nBonus\\n0 +2 14 +5\\n1/8 +2 15 +5\\n1/4 +2 16 +5\\n1/2 +2 17 +6\\n1 +2 18 +6\\n2 +2 19 +6\\n3 +2 20 +6\\n4 +2 21 +7\\n5 +3 22 +7\\n6 +3 23 +7\\n7 +3 24 +7\\n8 +3 25 +8\\n9 +4 26 +8\\n10 +4 27 +8\\n11 +4 28 +8\\n12 +4 29 +9\\n13 +5 30 +9\\nSkills\\nThe Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are profi -\\ncient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is \\nvery perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wis -\\ndom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\\n A skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability \\nmodifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined \\nby the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Profi -\\nciency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers \\nmight apply. For instance, a monster might have a larg -\\ner-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency \\nbonus) to account for its heightened expertise.\\nVulnerabilities, Resistances, \\nand Immunities\\nSome creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immu -\\nnity to certain types of damage. Particular creatures are \\neven resistant or immune to damage from nonmagical at -\\ntacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered by a spell, a magic item, or another magical source). In addition, some \\ncreatures are immune to certain conditions.\\nSenses\\nThe Senses entry notes a monster’s passive Wisdom \\n(Perception) score, as well as any special senses the mon -\\nster might have. Special senses are described below.\\nBlindsight\\nA monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings \\nwithout relying on sight, within a specific radius. \\n Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray \\noozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures \\nwith echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and \\ntrue dragons.\\n If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical \\nnote to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blind -\\nsight defines the maximum range of its perception. \\nDarkvision\\nA monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a \\nspecific radius. The monster can see in dim light within \\nthe radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as \\nif it were dim light. The monster can’t discern color in \\ndarkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live \\nunderground have this special sense.\\nTremorsense\\nA monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the \\norigin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided \\nthat the monster and the source of the vibrations are in \\ncontact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense \\ncan’t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. \\nMany burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber \\nhulks, have this special sense.\\nTruesight\\nA monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see \\nin normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures \\nand objects, automatically detect visual illusions and \\nsucceed on saving throws against them, and perceive \\nthe original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is \\ntransformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see \\ninto the Ethereal Plane within the same range.\\nLanguages\\nThe languages that a monster can speak are listed in al -\\nphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a \\nlanguage but can’t speak it, and this is noted in its entry. \\nA “—” indicates that a creature neither speaks nor under -\\nstands any language.\\nTelepathy\\nTelepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to \\ncommunicate mentally with another creature within a \\nspecified range. The contacted creature doesn’t need to \\nshare a language with the monster to communicate in \\nthis way with it, but it must be able to understand at least \\none language. A creature without telepathy can receive \\nand respond to telepathic messages but can’t initiate or \\nterminate a telepathic conversation.\\n A telepathic monster doesn’t need to see a contacted \\ncreature and can end the telepathic contact at any time.

Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are \\nno longer within range of each other or if the telepathic \\nmonster contacts a different creature within range. A \\ntelepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic \\nconversation without using an action, but while the mon -\\nster is incapacitated, it can’t initiate telepathic contact, \\nand any current contact is terminated.\\n A creature within the area of an antimagic field or in \\nany other location where magic doesn’t function can’t \\nsend or receive telepathic messages.\\nChallenge\\nA monster’s challenge rating  tells you how great a threat \\nthe monster is, according to the encounter-building \\nguidelines in chapter 13 of this document. Those guide -\\nlines specify the number of adventurers of a certain level \\nthat should be able to defeat a monster of a particular \\nchallenge rating without suffering any deaths.\\n Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-level \\ncharacters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Mon -\\nsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except \\nin large numbers; those with no effective attacks are \\nworth no experience points, while those that have attacks \\nare worth 10 XP each.\\n Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a \\ntypical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have \\na challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically de -\\nsigned to test player skill.\\nExperience Points\\nThe number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth \\nis based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded \\nfor defeating the monster, although the DM may also \\naward XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the mon -\\nster in some other manner.\\n Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster sum -\\nmoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP \\nnoted in its stat block.\\n The guidelines in chapter 13 of this document explain \\nhow to create encounters using XP budgets, as well as \\nhow to adjust an encounter’s difficulty.\\nExperience Points by Challenge Rating\\nChallenge XP Challenge XP\\n0 0 or 10 14 11,500\\n1/8 25 15 13,000\\n1/4 50 16 15,000\\n1/2 100 17 18,000\\n1 200 18 20,000\\n2 450 19 22,000\\n3 700 20 25,000\\n4 1,100 21 33,000\\n5 1,800 22 41,000\\n6 2,300 23 50,000\\n7 2,900 24 62,000\\n8 3,900 25 75,000\\n9 5,000 26 90,000\\n10 5,900 27 105,000\\n11 7,200 28 120,000\\n12 8,400 29 135,000\\n13 10,000 30 155,000Special Traits\\nSpecial traits (which appear after a monster’s challenge \\nrating but before any actions or reactions) are character -\\nistics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter \\nand that require some explanation.\\nInnate Spellcasting\\nA monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the \\nInnate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, \\nan innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its \\nlowest possible level and can’t be cast at a higher level. \\nIf a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no \\nlevel is given, use the monster’s challenge rating.\\n An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. \\nFor example, a drow mage can innately cast the levitate  \\nspell, but the spell has a “self only” restriction, which \\nmeans that the spell affects only the drow mage.\\n A monster’s innate spells can’t be swapped out with \\nother spells. If a monster’s innate spells don’t require at -\\ntack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.\\nSpellcasting\\nA monster with the Spellcasting class feature has a spell -\\ncaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells \\nof 1st level and higher (as explained in chapter 10 of this \\ndocument). The spellcaster level is also used for any can -\\ntrips included in the feature.\\n The monster has a list of spells known or prepared \\nfrom a particular class. The list might also include spells \\nfrom a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain \\nfeature of the cleric. The monster is considered a mem -\\nber of that class when attuning to or using a magic item \\nthat requires membership in the class or access to its \\nspell list.\\n A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level \\nif it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage \\nwith the 3rd-level lightning bolt spell can cast it as a 5th-\\nlevel spell by using one of its 5th-level spell slots.\\n You can change the spells that a monster knows or has \\nprepared, replacing any spell on a monster’s spell list \\nwith a different spell of the same level and from the same \\nclass list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to \\nbe a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its chal -\\nlenge rating.\\nActions\\nWhen a monster takes its action, it can choose from \\nthe options in the Actions section of its stat block or \\nuse one of the actions available to all creatures, such \\nas the Dash or Hide action, as described in chapter 9 of \\nthis document.\\nMelee and Ranged Attacks\\nThe most common actions that a monster will take in \\ncombat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell \\nattacks or weapon attacks, where the “weapon” might be \\na manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw \\nor tail spike. For more information on different kinds of \\nattacks, see chapter 9 of this document.\\n Creature vs. Target.  The target of a melee or ranged \\nattack is usually either one creature or one target, the \\ndifference being that a “target” can be a creature or \\nan object.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 113}, page_content='114114 Chapter 12: Monsters\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only. Hit. Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as \\na result of an attack hitting a target are described after \\nthe “ Hit” notation. You have the option of taking average \\ndamage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the \\naverage damage and the die expression are presented.\\n Miss.  If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, \\nthat information is presented after the “ Miss: ” notation.\\nMultiattack\\nA creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has \\nthe Multiattack ability. A creature can’t use Multiattack \\nwhen making an opportunity attack, which must be a sin -\\ngle melee attack.\\nAmmunition\\nA monster carries enough ammunition to make its \\nranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 \\npieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and \\n2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such \\nas a bow or crossbow.\\nReactions\\nIf a monster can do something special with its reaction, \\nthat information is contained here. If a creature has no \\nspecial reaction, this section is absent.\\nLimited Usage\\nSome special abilities have restrictions on the number of \\ntimes they can be used.\\n X/Day.  The notation “X/Day” means a special ability \\ncan be used X number of times and that a monster must \\nfinish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, \\n“1/Day” means a special ability can be used once and that \\nthe monster must finish a long rest to use it again.\\n Recharge X–Y. The notation “Recharge X–Y” means a \\nmonster can use a special ability once and that the ability \\nthen has a random chance of recharging during each \\nsubsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the \\nmonster’s turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers \\nin the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of \\nthe special ability. The ability also recharges when the \\nmonster finishes a short or long rest.\\n For example, “Recharge 5–6” means a monster can \\nuse the special ability once. Then, at the start of the mon -\\nster’s turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or \\n6 on a d6.\\n Recharge after a Short or Long Rest. This notation \\nmeans that a monster can use a special ability once and \\nthen must finish a short or long rest to use it again.Equipment\\nA stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor \\nor weapons used by a monster. A creature that customar -\\nily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be \\ndressed appropriately.\\n You can equip monsters with additional gear and trin -\\nkets however you like, using chapter 5 of this document \\nfor inspiration, and you decide how much of a monster’s \\nequipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and \\nwhether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered \\nsuit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by \\nsomeone else, for instance.\\n If a spellcasting monster needs material components \\nto cast its spells, assume that it has the material compo -\\nnents it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.\\nLegendary Creatures\\nA legendary creature can do things that ordinary crea -\\ntures can’t. It can take special actions outside its turn, \\nand it might exert magical influence for miles around.\\n If a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature, \\nsuch as through a spell, it doesn’t gain that form’s legend -\\nary actions, lair actions, or regional effects.\\nLegendary Actions\\nA legendary creature can take a certain number of \\nspecial actions—called legendary actions—outside its \\nturn. Only one legendary action option can be used at \\na time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. A \\ncreature regains its spent legendary actions at the start \\nof its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can’t use them \\nwhile incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. \\nIf surprised, it can’t use them until after its first turn in \\nthe combat.\\nA Legendary Creature’s Lair\\nA legendary creature might have a section describing \\nits lair and the special effects it can create while there, \\neither by act of will or simply by being present. Not all \\nlegendary creatures have lairs. This section applies only \\nto legendary creatures that spend a great deal of time in \\ntheir lairs and are most likely to be encountered there.\\nLair Actions\\nIf a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them \\nto harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative \\ncount 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair \\naction options. It can’t do so while incapacitated or other -\\nwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use one \\nuntil after its first turn in the combat.\\nRegional Effects\\nThe mere presence of a legendary creature can have \\nstrange and wondrous effects on its environment, as \\nnoted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dis -\\nsipate over time when the legendary creature dies.\\nGrapple Rules for Monsters\\nMany monsters have special attacks that allow them to \\nquickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an \\nattack, it doesn’t need to make an additional ability check to \\ndetermine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack \\nsays otherwise.\\n A creature grappled by the monster can use its action \\nto try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength \\n(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the \\nescape DC in the monster’s stat block. If no escape DC \\nis given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster’s Strength \\n(Athletics) modifier.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 114}, page_content='115115 Chapter 12: Monsters\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Melee Weapon Attack:  +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. \\nHit: 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.\\nFrightful Presence. Each creature of the dragon’s choice that \\nis within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed \\non a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 \\nminute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of \\neach of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a \\ncreature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, \\nthe creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for \\nthe next 24 hours.\\nFire Breath (Recharge 5–6). The dragon exhales fire in a \\n60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 \\nDexterity saving throw, taking 63 (18d6) fire damage on a \\nfailed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\\nLegendary Actions\\nThe dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the \\noptions below. Only one legendary action option can be used \\nat a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The \\ndragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\\nDetect.  The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.\\nTail Attack. The dragon makes a tail attack.\\nWing Attack (Costs 2 Actions). The dragon beats its wings. \\nEach creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed \\non a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) \\nbludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon \\ncan then fly up to half its flying speed.The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, \\nwhose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhou -\\nette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its \\neyes dance with flame when it is angry.\\nA Red Dragon’s Lair\\nRed dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling in \\ncaverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep \\nhalls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. \\nCaves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most \\nhighly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards that hin -\\nder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanic gases \\nwash over a dragon as it sleeps.\\n With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red \\ndragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain \\nas in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world \\nare the throne from which it can look out to survey all it \\ncontrols—and the wider world it seeks to control.\\n Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monu -\\nments to the dragon’s power, telling the grim story of \\nits life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has \\nconquered.\\nLair Actions\\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon \\ntakes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; \\nthe dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\\n• Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon \\ncan see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, \\n5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser’s area \\nmust make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking \\n21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much \\ndamage on a successful one.\\n• A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the \\ndragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the \\nground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity \\nsaving throw or be knocked prone.\\n• Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere \\ncentered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet \\nof it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area \\nis lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on \\nthe next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the \\ncloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving \\nthrow or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While \\npoisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.\\nRegional Effects\\nThe region containing a legendary red dragon’s lair is \\nwarped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more \\nof the following effects:\\n• Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the \\ndragon’s lair.\\n• Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernatu -\\nrally warm and tainted by sulfur.\\n• Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair form \\nportals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing crea -\\ntures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.\\nIf the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of \\n1d10 days.Monster Stat Blocks'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 115}, page_content='116116 Chapter 12: Monsters\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Once you have the details figured out, use this sec -\\ntion to adjust the difficulty of the encounter.\\nCombat Encounter Difficulty\\nThere are four categories of encounter difficulty.\\n Easy. An easy encounter doesn’t tax the characters’ \\nresources or put them in serious peril. They might lose a \\nfew hit points, but victory is pretty much guaranteed.\\n Medium.  A medium encounter usually has one or two \\nscary moments for the players, but the characters should \\nemerge victorious with no casualties. One or more of \\nthem might need to use healing resources.\\n Hard. A hard encounter could go badly for the adven -\\nturers. Weaker characters might get taken out of the \\nfight, and there’s a slim chance that one or more charac -\\nters might die.\\n Deadly.  A deadly encounter could be lethal for one or \\nmore player characters. Survival often requires good tac -\\ntics and quick thinking, and the party risks defeat.\\nXP Thresholds by Character Level\\nCharacter \\nLevel————— Encounter Difficulty —————\\nEasy Medium Hard Deadly\\n1st 25 50 75 100\\n2nd 50 100 150 200\\n3rd 75 150 225 400\\n4th 125 250 375 500\\n5th 250 500 750 1,100\\n6th 300 600 900 1,400\\n7th 350 750 1,100 1,700\\n8th 450 900 1,400 2,100\\n9th 550 1,100 1,600 2,400\\n10th 600 1,200 1,900 2,800\\n11th 800 1,600 2,400 3,600\\n12th 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,500\\n13th 1,100 2,200 3,400 5,100\\n14th 1,250 2,500 3,800 5,700\\n15th 1,400 2,800 4,300 6,400\\n16th 1,600 3,200 4,800 7,200\\n17th 2,000 3,900 5,900 8,800\\n18th 2,100 4,200 6,300 9,500\\n19th 2,400 4,900 7,300 10,900\\n20th 2,800 5,700 8,500 12,700\\nEvaluating Encounter Difficulty\\nUse the following method to gauge the difficulty of any \\ncombat encounter.\\n 1. Determine XP Thresholds. First, determine the ex -\\nperience point (XP) thresholds for each character in the \\nparty. The XP Thresholds by Character Level table has \\nfour XP thresholds for each character level, one for each \\ncategory of encounter difficulty. Use a character’s level to \\ndetermine his or her XP thresholds. Repeat this process \\nfor every character in the party. 2. Determine the Party’s XP Threshold. For each \\ncategory of encounter difficulty, add up the characters’ \\nXP thresholds. This determines the party’s XP threshold. \\nYou’ll end up with four totals, one for each category of en -\\ncounter difficulty.\\n For example, if your party includes three 3rd-level \\ncharacters and one 2nd-level character, the party’s \\ntotaled XP thresholds would be as follows:\\nEasy:  275 XP (75 + 75 + 75 + 50)\\nMedium:  550 XP (150 + 150 + 150 + 100)\\nHard:  825 XP (225 + 225 + 225 + 150)\\nDeadly: 1,400 XP (400 + 400 + 400 + 200)\\nRecord the totals, because you can use them for every \\nencounter in your adventure.\\n 3. Total the Monsters’ XP. Add up the XP for all of \\nthe monsters in the encounter. Every monster has an XP \\nvalue in its stat block.\\n 4. Modify Total XP for Multiple Monsters. If the \\nencounter includes more than one monster, apply a \\nmultiplier to the monsters’ total XP. The more monsters \\nthere are, the more attack rolls you’re making against the \\ncharacters in a given round, and the more dangerous the \\nencounter becomes. To correctly gauge an encounter’s \\ndifficulty, multiply the total XP of all the monsters in \\nthe encounter by the value given in the Encounter Multi -\\npliers table.\\n For example, if an encounter includes four monsters \\nworth a total of 500 XP, you would multiply the total XP \\nof the monsters by 2, for an adjusted value of 1,000 XP. \\nThis adjusted value is not  what the monsters are worth in \\nterms of XP; the adjusted value’s only purpose is to help \\nyou accurately assess the encounter’s difficulty.\\n When making this calculation, don’t count any mon -\\nsters whose challenge rating is significantly below the \\naverage challenge rating of the other monsters in the \\ngroup unless you think the weak monsters significantly \\ncontribute to the difficulty of the encounter.\\nEncounter Multipliers\\nNumber of \\nMonsters Multiplier\\n1 × 1\\n2 × 1.5\\n3–6 × 2Number of \\nMonsters Multiplier\\n7–10 × 2.5\\n11–14 × 3\\n15 or more × 4\\n 5. Compare XP. Compare the monsters’ adjusted XP \\nvalue to the party’s XP thresholds. The threshold that \\nequals the adjusted XP value determines the encounter’s \\ndifficulty. If there’s no match, use the closest threshold \\nthat is lower than the adjusted XP value.\\n For example, an encounter with one bugbear and three \\nhobgoblins has an adjusted XP value of 1,000, making it \\na hard encounter for a party of three 3rd-level characters \\nand one 2nd-level character (which has a hard encounter \\nthreshold of 825 XP and a deadly encounter threshold of \\n1,400 XP).Chapter 13: Building Combat Encounters'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 165}, page_content='166166 Chapter 13: Building Combat Encounters\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Party Size\\nThe preceding guidelines assume that you have a party \\nconsisting of three to five adventurers.\\n If the party contains fewer than three characters, apply \\nthe next highest multiplier on the Encounter Multipliers \\ntable. For example, apply a multiplier of 1.5 when the \\ncharacters fight a single monster, and a multiplier of 5 for \\ngroups of fifteen or more monsters.\\n If the party contains six or more characters, use the \\nnext lowest multiplier on the table. Use a multiplier of 0.5 \\nfor a single monster.\\nMultipart Encounters\\nSometimes an encounter features multiple enemies that \\nthe party doesn’t face all at once. For example, monsters \\nmight come at the party in waves. For such encounters, \\ntreat each discrete part or wave as a separate encounter \\nfor the purpose of determining its difficulty.\\n A party can’t benefit from a short rest between parts of \\na multipart encounter, so they won’t be able to spend Hit \\nDice to regain hit points or recover any abilities that re -\\nquire a short rest to regain. As a rule, if the adjusted XP \\nvalue for the monsters in a multipart encounter is higher \\nthan one-third of the party’s expected XP total for the \\nadventuring day (see “The Adventuring Day,” below), the \\nencounter is going to be tougher than the sum of its parts.\\nBuilding Encounters on a \\nBudget\\nYou can build an encounter if you know its desired diffi -\\nculty. The party’s XP thresholds give you an XP budget \\nthat you can spend on monsters to build easy, medium, \\nhard, and deadly encounters. Just remember that groups \\nof monsters eat up more of that budget than their base \\nXP values would indicate (see step 4).\\n For example, using the party from step 2, you can build \\na medium encounter by making sure that the adjusted \\nXP value of the monsters is at least 550 XP (the party’s \\nthreshold for a medium encounter) and no more than 825 \\nXP (the party’s threshold for a hard encounter). A single \\nmonster of challenge rating 3 (such as a manticore or \\nowlbear) is worth 700 XP, so that’s one possibility. If you \\nwant a pair of monsters, each one will count for 1.5 times \\nits base XP value. A pair of dire wolves (worth 200 XP \\neach) have an adjusted XP value of 600, making them a \\nmedium encounter for the party as well.\\n To assist with this approach, appendix B in the Dun -\\ngeon Master’s Guide presents a list of all monsters in \\nthe Monster Manual organized by challenge rating. See \\n“Monsters by Challenge Rating” later in this chapter for a \\nlist by CR of the monsters included in this document.\\nThe Adventuring Day\\nAssuming typical adventuring conditions and average \\nluck, most adventuring parties can handle about six to \\neight medium or hard encounters in a day. If the adven -\\nture has more easy encounters, the adventurers can get \\nthrough more. If it has more deadly encounters, they can \\nhandle fewer.\\n In the same way you figure out the difficulty of an en -\\ncounter, you can use the XP values of monsters and other opponents in an adventure as a guideline for how far the \\nparty is likely to progress.\\n For each character in the party, use the Adventuring \\nDay XP table to estimate how much XP that character is \\nexpected to earn in a day. Add together the values of all \\nparty members to get a total for the party’s adventuring \\nday. This provides a rough estimate of the adjusted XP \\nvalue for encounters the party can handle before the \\ncharacters will need to take a long rest.\\nAdventuring Day XP\\nLevelAdjusted XP per Day \\nper Character\\n1st 300\\n2nd 600\\n3rd 1,200\\n4th 1,700\\n5th 3,500\\n6th 4,000\\n7th 5,000\\n8th 6,000\\n9th 7,500\\n10th 9,000LevelAdjusted XP per Day \\nper Character\\n11th 10,500\\n12th 11,500\\n13th 13,500\\n14th 15,000\\n15th 18,000\\n16th 20,000\\n17th 25,000\\n18th 27,000\\n19th 30,000\\n20th 40,000\\nShort Rests\\nIn general, over the course of a full adventuring day, the \\nparty will likely need to take two short rests, about one-\\nthird and two-thirds of the way through the day.\\nModifying Encounter Difficulty\\nAn encounter can be made easier or harder based on the \\nchoice of location and the situation.\\n Increase the difficulty of the encounter by one step \\n(from easy to medium, for example) if the characters have \\na drawback that their enemies don’t. Reduce the difficulty \\nby one step if the characters have a benefit that their en -\\nemies don’t. Any additional benefit or drawback pushes \\nthe encounter one step in the appropriate direction. If the \\ncharacters have both a benefit and a drawback, the two \\ncancel each other out.\\n Situational drawbacks include the following:\\n• The whole party is surprised, and the enemy isn’t.\\n• The enemy has cover, and the party doesn’t.\\n• The characters are unable to see the enemy.\\n• The characters are taking damage every round from \\nsome environmental effect or magical source.\\n• The characters are hanging from a rope, in the midst of \\nscaling a sheer wall or cliff, stuck to the floor, or other -\\nwise in a situation that hinders their mobility.\\n Situational benefits are similar to drawbacks except \\nthat they benefit the characters instead of the enemy.\\nFun Combat Encounters\\nThe following features can add more fun and suspense to \\na combat encounter:\\n• Terrain features that pose inherent risks to both the \\ncharacters and their enemies, such as a frayed rope \\nbridge and pools of green slime\\n• Terrain features that provide a change of elevation, \\nsuch as pits, stacks of empty crates, and ledges'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 166}, page_content='167167 Chapter 13: Building Combat Encounters\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

This \\nchapter  presents an assortment of magic items that hints \\nat the wider variety of magic items waiting to be found in \\nthe worlds of D&D. See the Dungeon Master’s Guide for \\nmany more items.\\nUsing a Magic Item\\nA magic item’s description explains how the item works. \\nHandling a magic item is enough to give a character a \\nsense that something is extraordinary about the item. \\nThe identify  spell is the fastest way to reveal an item’s \\nproperties. Alternatively, a character can focus on one \\nmagic item during a short rest, while being in physical \\ncontact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character \\nlearns the item’s properties, as well as how to use them. \\nPotions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the \\ntaster what the potion does.\\n Some magic items require a creature to form a bond \\nwith them before their magical properties can be used. \\nThis bond is called attunement , and certain items have a \\nprerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, a creature \\nmust be a member of that class to attune to the item. If \\nthe prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creature qualifies \\nif it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features, \\nnot using a magic item or the like.\\n Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short \\nrest focused on only that item while being in physical con -\\ntact with it (this can’t be the same short rest used to learn \\nthe item’s properties). This focus can take the form of \\nweapon practice, meditation, or some other appropriate \\nactivity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement \\nattempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the \\ncreature gains an intuitive understanding of how to ac -\\ntivate any magical properties of the item, including any \\nnecessary command words.\\n An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, \\nand a creature can be attuned to no more than three \\nmagic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth \\nitem fails; the creature must end its attunement to an \\nitem first. Additionally, a creature can’t attune to more \\nthan one copy of an item. For example, a creature can’t \\nattune to more than one ring of protection at a time.\\n A creature’s attunement to an item ends if the creature \\nno longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if \\nthe item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 \\nhours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes \\nto the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attune -\\nment by spending another short rest focused on the item, \\nunless the item is cursed.Item Descriptions\\nAmulet of Health\\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\\nYour Constitution score is 19 while you wear this amulet. \\nIt has no effect on you if your Constitution is 19 or higher \\nwithout it.\\nArmor, +1, +2, or +3\\nArmor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (+1), very rare (+2), \\nor legendary (+3)\\nYou have a bonus to AC while wearing this armor.

The bag can hold up to 500 \\npounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag \\nweighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving \\nan item from the bag requires an action.\\n If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures \\nand is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the \\nAstral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents \\nspill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right be -\\nfore it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the \\nbag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 \\ndivided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), \\nafter which time they begin to suffocate.\\n Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional \\nspace created by a Heward’s handy haversack , portable \\nhole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and \\nopens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates \\nwhere the one item was placed inside the other. Any \\ncreature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it \\nto a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then \\ncloses. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.\\nBoots of Striding and Springing\\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\\nWhile you wear these boots, your walking speed be -\\ncomes 30 feet, unless your walking speed is higher, and \\nyour speed isn’t reduced if you are encumbered or wear -\\ning heavy armor. In addition, you can jump three times \\nthe normal distance, though you can’t jump farther than \\nyour remaining movement would allow.\\nCloak of Elvenkind\\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\\nWhile you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom (Per -\\nception) checks made to see you have disadvantage, and \\nyou have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to \\nhide, as the cloak’s color shifts to camouflage you.

Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.Religion is an important part of life in the worlds of \\nthe D&D multiverse. When gods walk the world, clerics \\nchannel divine power, evil cults perform dark sacrifices \\nin subterranean lairs, and shining paladins stand like \\nbeacons against the darkness, it’s hard to be ambivalent \\nabout the deities and deny their existence.\\n Many people in the worlds of D&D worship different \\ngods at different times and circumstances. People in the \\nForgotten Realms, for example, might pray to Sune for \\nluck in love, make an offering to Waukeen before heading \\nto the market, and pray to appease Talos when a severe \\nstorm blows in—all in the same day. Many people have a \\nfavorite among the gods, one whose ideals and teachings \\nthey make their own. And a few people dedicate them -\\nselves entirely to a single god, usually serving as a priest \\nor champion of that god’s ideals.\\n Your DM determines which gods, if any, are worshiped \\nin his or her campaign. From among the gods available, \\nyou can choose a single deity for your character to serve, \\nworship, or pay lip service to. Or you can pick a few that \\nyour character prays to most often. Or just make a mental \\nnote of the gods who are revered in your DM’s campaign \\nso you can invoke their names when appropriate. If you’re \\nplaying a cleric or a character with the Acolyte back -\\nground, decide which god your deity serves or served, and \\nconsider the deity’s suggested domains when selecting \\nyour character’s domain.\\nD&D Pantheons\\nEach world in the D&D multiverse has its own pantheons \\nof deities. This appendix deals with one pantheon, that of \\nthe Forgotten Realms.\\nThe Forgotten Realms\\nDozens of deities are revered, worshiped, and feared \\nthroughout the world of the Forgotten Realms. At least \\nthirty deities are widely known across the Realms, and \\nmany more are worshiped locally, by individual tribes, \\nsmall cults, or certain sects of larger religious temples.\\nNonhuman Deities\\nCertain gods closely associated with nonhuman races \\nare revered on many different worlds, though not always \\nin the same way. The nonhuman races of the Forgotten \\nRealms and Greyhawk share these deities.\\n Nonhuman races often have whole pantheons of \\ntheir own. Besides Moradin, for example, the dwarf \\ngods include Moradin’s wife, Berronar Truesilver, and \\na number of other gods thought to be their children \\nand grandchildren: Abbathor, Clangeddin Silverbeard, \\nDugmaren Brightmantle, Dumathoin, Gorm Gulthyn, \\nHaela Brightaxe, Marthammor Duin, Sharindlar, Thard \\nHarr, and Vergadain. Individual clans and kingdoms of \\ndwarves might revere some, all, or none of these deities, \\nand some have other gods unknown (or known by other \\nnames) to outsiders.Unconscious\\n• An unconscious creature is incapacitated (see the \\ncondition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware \\nof its surroundings.\\n• The creature drops whatever it’s holding and \\nfalls prone.\\n• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity \\nsaving throws.\\n• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.\\n• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the \\nattacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Appendix B: Gods of \\nthe Multiverse\\nExhaustion\\nSome special abilities and environmental hazards, such as \\nstarvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching \\ntemperatures, can lead to a special condition called \\nexhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect \\ncan give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as \\nspecified in the effect’s description.\\nLevel Effect\\n 1 Disadvantage on ability checks\\n 2 Speed halved\\n 3 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws \\n 4 Hit point maximum halved\\n 5 Speed reduced to 0\\n 6 Death\\nIf an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that \\ncauses exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases \\nby the amount specified in the effect’s description.\\n A creature suffers the effect of its current level of \\nexhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a \\ncreature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved \\nand has disadvantage on ability checks.\\n An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as \\nspecified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion \\neffects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is \\nreduced below 1.\\n Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level \\nby 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some \\nfood and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a \\ncreature’s exhaustion level by 1.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 172}, page_content='173173 Appendix B: Gods of the Multiverse\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

That \\nis why its members act on their \\nown authority, identifying threats \\nand removing them before they \\ncan reach their full potential.\\n Because the seeds of evil are \\nnourished in the shadows, the \\nOrder of the Gauntlet rides out to the most dangerous \\ndungeons, the darkest caverns, and the foulest pits to \\nweed out wrongdoers. Even so, its members are keenly \\naware that the seed of evil lies within everyone, waiting \\nfor a moment when it can take root in their souls. The or -\\nder’s paladins, monks, and clerics spend long hours deep \\nin prayer to keep their inner eye vigilant and focused on \\ntheir own thoughts and emotions. In this way they purify \\nthemselves from within before taking up their swords to \\ncleanse the world.\\n The Order of the Gauntlet believes that all sentient \\nbeings must come forth into the light of reason and good -\\nness of their own volition. That is why the faction is not \\ninterested in controlling minds: it focuses only on deeds, \\nsetting an example for the world in the hope of inspiring \\nand enlightening others. The order holds that faith in \\none’s god, one’s friends, and one’s self are the best weap -\\nons for combating the hordes of malice.\\n Possessed of such devout conviction, the order’s \\nmembers can be relied on as a source of strength \\nto themselves and others, a bright light against the \\ndarkness. They are not preemptive bullies, though. A \\nstrict code of honor allows them to strike only when \\nevil deeds are being committed. Thus, the Order of the \\nGauntlet is constantly vigilant, using every resource at its \\ndisposal—both magical and mundane—to tell where and \\nwhen dark deeds will occur.\\nThat’s the thing about evil: it is darkness, it is shadow, it hides \\nin your blind spot. Then, when you are distracted, it sneaks \\nin. Evil is a master of disguise—and what is the greatest dis-\\nguise, you ask? Yourself. Evil will cloak itself in thoughts and \\nemotions pretending to be your own, telling you to get angry, \\nto be greedy and envious, to hold yourself above others.Many characters created in the Forgotten Realms \\nsetting, especially those for organized D&D play, belong \\nto one of five factions that have risen to prominence in the \\nworld of Faerûn. Each faction has its own motivations, \\ngoals, and philosophy. Some are more heroic than others, \\nbut all band together in times of trouble to address ma -\\njor threats.\\nHarpers\\nThe clandestine network of \\nspellcasters and spies known \\nas the Harpers seeks to tip the \\nscales in favor of the innocent, \\nthe weak, and the poor. Harper \\nagents pride themselves on \\nbeing incorruptible defenders \\nof good, and they never hesitate \\nto aid the oppressed. Because \\nthey prefer to work behind the \\nscenes, they are rarely noticed \\nas they thwart tyrants, depose \\nrulers, and head off any growing \\nforce that is thought to have evil \\nintent. The faction has its finger \\non the pulse of power in the \\nRealms, and its members work tirelessly to even the odds \\nfor the downtrodden.\\n Individual Harper agents operate alone, relying on their \\nwits and the faction’s extensive information network to \\ngain an advantage over their enemies. They know that \\nknowledge is power, so gathering intelligence beforehand \\nis paramount to their success. They are well informed \\nand always have access to aid, magical and otherwise. \\nVeteran members have secret caches of information \\nstashed all over Faerûn, along with trusted sources sta -\\ntioned in every major town and city.\\n The organization is always on the lookout for pow -\\nerful items, expressly to keep them out of the hands of \\nevildoers. To this end, its agents use various guises and \\nidentities to aid their search for carefully guarded secrets \\nsuch as ancestral maps, buried cities, and mages’ keeps.\\n The bond between Harpers is strong, and the \\nfriendships they form are nigh unbreakable. Rarely do \\nthey operate in the open, but on rare occasions they must, \\nbecause there is no other choice. When that happens, \\nyou can be sure that a fellow Harper is watching closely, \\nready to dart out from the shadows and help a comrade at \\na moment’s notice.\\nA Harper is first and foremost self-reliant, for once you are \\nautonomous, no one can tempt you into using power as a \\ncrutch. You are sovereign unto yourself.\\n Therefore, a Harper’s soul must be incorruptible. Many \\nbelieve themselves to be so, but power comes in many guises, \\nand it will surely find your weakness. Of this you may be \\ncertain. Only a true Harper can pass this test and transform \\nweakness into strength.

That is why to know who \\nyou truly are is what the order requires from each hopeful \\nwho wishes to join our ranks. Bravery isn’t fighting the drag-\\non out there—it is fighting the dragon within. That is what \\nwe do in our prayers. Once you have slain that dragon, you \\nhave overcome the darkness lurking within yourself. Only \\nthen do you have the capacity to know true goodness. Only \\nthen are you ready to take up the sword and wear the badge \\nof our order.\\n—Kajiso Steelhand\\nEmerald Enclave\\nThe Emerald Enclave is a far-ranging group that opposes \\nthreats to the natural world and helps others survive \\nin the wilderness. Branches of \\nthe organization are scattered \\nthroughout Faerûn and often \\noperate in isolation from the \\nothers. This existence instills in \\nthe enclave’s members a fierce \\nself-reliance and mastery of cer -\\ntain fighting and survival skills.\\n A ranger of the enclave might \\nbe hired to lead a caravan \\nthrough a treacherous moun -\\ntain pass or across the frozen \\ntundra of Icewind Dale. A druid \\nmight volunteer to help a village \\nprepare for a long, brutal winter. \\nBarbarians and druids who live \\nas hermits might appear from nowhere to help defend a \\ntown against marauding orcs.\\n Members of the Emerald Enclave know how to survive \\nand, more important, how to help others do the same. \\nThey are not opposed to civilization or progress, but \\nthey strive to keep such “advances” in balance with the \\nwild. They restore and preserve the natural order, even \\nas they root out and destroy all that is unnatural. They \\nkeep the elemental forces of the world in check and \\nprevent civilization and the wilderness from destroying \\none another.\\nWe of the Emerald Enclave serve as gatekeepers to that vast \\nspace beyond the city walls. We are the defenders both of the \\nwilderness and of the society that does not understand it. \\nMost have forgotten that there is an ancient, natural order \\nthat held sway long before we formed our intellectual con-\\ncepts of it. To come into contact with that primal order is to \\ntouch the power that guides all of life.\\n Those who walk the way of the Emerald Enclave are \\ninfused with this power; we embody it, and it moves us to \\ndo our work. That is why we are never alone. Even in the midst of a noisy, crowded city, we can feel the presence of the \\nnatural world inside us, fresh, strong, and alive. The enclave \\nseeks to make awareness of this power available to all.\\n Freedom. Is not this the highest of callings?\\n—Delaan Winterhound\\nLords’ Alliance\\nThe Lords’ Alliance is an asso -\\nciation of rulers from cities and \\ntowns across Faerûn (primarily \\nin the North), who believe that \\nsolidarity is needed to keep evil \\nat bay. The rulers of Waterdeep, \\nSilverymoon, Neverwinter, and \\nother free cities dominate the \\ncoalition, and all lords in the alli -\\nance work primarily for the fate \\nand fortune of their individual \\nsettlements.\\n Alliance agents include sophis -\\nticated bards, zealous paladins, \\ntalented mages, and grizzled \\nwarriors. They are chosen pri -\\nmarily for their loyalty and are experts in observation, \\nstealth, innuendo, and combat. Backed by the wealthy \\nand the privileged, they carry fine equipment (often dis -\\nguised to appear common), including large numbers of \\nscrolls scribed with spells of communication.\\n Agents of the Lords’ Alliance ensure the safety and \\nprosperity of civilized Faerûn by standing united against \\nthe forces that threaten civilization. They aggressively \\neliminate such threats by any means, fighting with pride \\nfor the glory and security of their people, and for the \\nwelfare of the lords who rule over those folk. Alliance \\noperatives are often motivated by glory, looking to gain \\nan advantage in status over their counterparts from \\nother alliance cities. The leaders of the faction know that \\nthe group will survive only if its members support each \\nother, requiring all to find a balance between pride and \\ndiplomacy. Rogue agents within the Lords’ Alliance are \\nrare, but defections have been known to occur.\\nEveryone wants to sleep at night and feel safe in their homes, \\nbut how many want to do what it takes to keep the tide of \\nevil at bay? To stand in the cold and rain, waiting for battle \\nwhile hunger gnaws at their bellies? Many wish to reap the \\nrewards of a good harvest, but few care to remove the stones \\nand till the fields for planting.\\n The Lords’ Alliance fights the things that the shopkeeper in \\nhis bed has never even heard of. We remove threats before \\nthe town mayor even knows about them. We make bad \\nthings go away.

The organization encourages individual ambition and \\nrewards innovators who take matters into their own \\nhands. Results are all that matter. Those who come \\ninto the Black Network with nothing can become major \\nplayers within the organization through their own \\nambition and perseverance.\\nMembership in the Zhentarim is like a key to a thousand \\ndoors, each one a gateway to fulfilling a personal desire. \\nMost people shy away from this kind of freedom. They like \\ntheir restraints, laws, and swaddling—it gives them the illu-\\nsion of security.\\n The Black Network provides what I need to explore realms \\nand dimensions that would tear apart minds accustomed to \\nlimits. Only in such places can I find magic powerful enough \\nto defeat beings that know no such things as time, fear, or \\nmercy. You might not like the Zhentarim’s methods, but when \\na demon crawls out of the Abyss and comes for your family, \\nyou’ll be glad that I have gone to the darkest of realms to find \\nthe answer to your problem.\\n—Ianna AsterionZhentarim\\nThe Zhentarim, also called the \\nBlack Network, is an organiza -\\ntion of well-trained mercenaries, \\nsavvy rogues, and crafty war -\\nlocks who seek to expand their \\ninfluence and power throughout \\nFaerûn. Agents of the Zhen -\\ntarim believe that if they play \\nby the rules, nothing gets done. \\nUltimately, they want to make \\nthe rules—and, in some cases, \\nthey already have. They walk a \\ncareful line when it comes to fol -\\nlowing the letter of the law and \\ndon’t shy away from the occa -\\nsional shady deal or illicit activity \\nto get what they want.\\n To the Zhentarim, wealth is power. Its agents know \\nthat nothing else inspires such confidence and dispels \\ndoubt so well. Zhentarim agents routinely carry the finest \\nweapons and armor, since the faction spares no expense \\nin their outfitting. When a merchant needs an escort for a \\ncaravan, when a noble family requires bodyguards to pro -\\ntect its holdings, or when a city is desperate for trained \\nsoldiers to defend its walls, the Zhentarim provides the \\nbest warriors money can buy.RICHARD WHITTERS'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\connor\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\portfolio\\\\rag\\\\data\\\\DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf', 'page': 176}, page_content='raceclass & level Player Name\\ncharacter NameBackgrouNd\\nexPerieNce PoiNts aligNmeNt\\nTM & © 2014 Wizards of the Coast LLC.

If you don’t know any DMs, try tak -\\ning on that role yourself. The Starter Set is the best place \\nto begin your journey.\\n The Player’s Handbook is your essential guide to \\nadditional races, classes, backgrounds, and other cus -\\ntomization options such as feats and multiclassing. You’ll \\nalso find more than two hundred extra spells and a beau -\\ntiful array of art depicting elements of D&D.\\n The Monster Manual describes the most important \\nmonsters in the Dungeons & Dragons universe. The \\nmanual is aimed at DMs, but it’s also a useful reference \\nfor players.\\n The Dungeon Master’s Guide is the ultimate tome of \\nDM lore. It includes magic items, optional rules, and \\nguidelines for creating everything from a simple dungeon \\nto an entire cosmos for your campaign. \\n Each year brings the publication of new D&D  adven -\\ntures. These scenarios and campaigns are the perfect \\nway to try your hand at running a D&D  game with a mini -\\nmum of work. \\n Looking for a regular D&D  game or prefer dropping in \\nwhen you have time? Check the Store and Event Locator \\non our website to see if your local game store is running \\nevents such as D&D  Encounters or D&D  Expeditions.\\n Bring your games to life with a suite of enhancements \\nfrom a robust set of player and DM digital tools to ac -\\ncessories like miniatures, vinyl mats, campaign maps, \\nclothing, and more. It isn’t always possible to gather a regular gaming \\ngroup. In such situations, Dungeons & Dragons  \\nboard games present an ideal casual play experience. \\nYou’ll also find a variety of digital games that offer a D&D  \\nexperience across Mac, PC, tablets, and mobile devices.\\nLevel up your D&D game by visiting \\nDungeonsandDragons.com  \\nto see the suite of  \\nDungeons  & Dragons  offerings.JAIME JONES')]"
